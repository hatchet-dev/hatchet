This is the official Ruby SDK for [Hatchet](https://hatchet.run), a distributed, fault-tolerant task queue. The SDK allows you to easily integrate Hatchet's task scheduling and workflow orchestration capabilities into your Ruby applications.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'hatchet'
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
gem install hatchet
```

## Quick Start

For examples of how to use the Hatchet Ruby SDK, including worker setup and task execution, please see our [official documentation](https://docs.hatchet.run/home/setup).

## Features

- üîÑ **Workflow Orchestration**: Define complex workflows with dependencies and parallel execution
- üîÅ **Automatic Retries**: Configure retry policies for handling transient failures
- üìä **Observability**: Track workflow progress and monitor execution metrics
- ‚è∞ **Scheduling**: Schedule workflows to run at specific times or on a recurring basis
- üîÑ **Event-Driven**: Trigger workflows based on events in your system

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

Run tests with `bundle exec rspec spec`.

This project uses `gem-release` to help with versioning.

```
$ gem bum # bumps to the next patch version
$ gem bump --version minor # bumps to the next minor version
$ gem bump --version major # bumps to the next major version
$ gem bump --version 1.1.1 # bumps to the specified version
```
