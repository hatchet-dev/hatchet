# Branching

**Branching** lets your workflow take different paths based on conditions evaluated at runtime. A task can inspect the output of a parent task, wait for an external event, or sleep for a duration, and then decide whether to run, skip, or cancel downstream tasks. Only the relevant branch executes, while the other is skipped.

<BranchingDiagram />

## How It Works

<Steps>

### A task produces output

An upstream task runs and returns a result (for example, a score, a flag, or a status value).

### Conditions evaluate the output

Downstream tasks declare conditions using `skip_if`, `wait_for`, or `cancel_if`. Hatchet evaluates these conditions against parent outputs, incoming events, or sleep timers.

### One branch executes

The branch whose condition is satisfied runs.

</Steps>

## Types of Conditions

| Condition            | Behavior                                                                           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Parent condition** | Evaluate a CEL expression against a parent task's output (e.g. `value > 50`)       |
| **Event condition**  | Wait for an external event, optionally filtered by a CEL expression on its payload |
| **Sleep condition**  | Wait for a specified duration before continuing                                    |

## Condition Operators

| Operator    | Effect                                                                              |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `wait_for`  | Task waits until the condition is satisfied before starting                         |
| `skip_if`   | Task is skipped if the condition evaluates to true                                  |
| `cancel_if` | Task and its downstream dependents are cancelled if the condition evaluates to true |

<Callout type="info">
  Branching is built using conditions on DAG tasks. See [Parent Conditions](/concepts/durable-workflows/directed-acyclic-graphs/parent-conditions),
  [Event Conditions](/concepts/durable-workflows/directed-acyclic-graphs/event-conditions),
  and [Sleep Conditions](/concepts/durable-workflows/directed-acyclic-graphs/sleep-conditions)
  for full code examples covering each condition type, or groups, and operators.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  A task cancelled by `cancel_if` behaves like any other cancellation, and all
  downstream tasks are cancelled as well. Use `skip_if` when you want downstream
  tasks to still run and inspect the skip status.

  <Cards.Card title="Feature Flag Routing" href="/concepts/durable-workflows/directed-acyclic-graphs/parent-conditions">
    Read a feature flag in an upstream task and route the workflow down
    different code paths based on its value.

    Pause workflow execution until a human approves or rejects, then branch
    accordingly.

## Next Steps

- [Parent Conditions](/concepts/durable-workflows/directed-acyclic-graphs/parent-conditions): branch based on parent task output
- [Event Conditions](/concepts/durable-workflows/directed-acyclic-graphs/event-conditions): react to external events, or groups, and operators
- [DAG Workflows](/concepts/durable-workflows/directed-acyclic-graphs): define task dependencies that branching builds on
- [Fanout](/patterns/fanout): dynamically spawn tasks instead of choosing between fixed branches
- [Pre-Determined Pipelines](/patterns/pre-determined-pipelines): fixed-structure pipelines without branching
