# Branching

**Branching** lets your workflow take different paths based on conditions evaluated at runtime. A task can inspect the output of a parent task, wait for an external event, or sleep for a duration, and then decide whether to run, skip, or cancel downstream tasks. Only the relevant branch executes, while the other is skipped.

<BranchingDiagram />

## How It Works

<Steps>

### A task produces output

An upstream task runs and returns a result (for example, a score, a flag, or a status value).

### Conditions evaluate the output

Downstream tasks declare conditions using `skip_if`, `wait_for`, or `cancel_if`. Hatchet evaluates these conditions against parent outputs, incoming events, or sleep timers.

### One branch executes

The branch whose condition is satisfied runs.

</Steps>

## Types of Conditions

| Condition            | Behavior                                                                           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Parent condition** | Evaluate a CEL expression against a parent task's output (e.g. `value > 50`)       |
| **Event condition**  | Wait for an external event, optionally filtered by a CEL expression on its payload |
| **Sleep condition**  | Wait for a specified duration before continuing                                    |

## Condition Operators

| Operator    | Effect                                                                              |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `wait_for`  | Task waits until the condition is satisfied before starting                         |
| `skip_if`   | Task is skipped if the condition evaluates to true                                  |
| `cancel_if` | Task and its downstream dependents are cancelled if the condition evaluates to true |

<Callout type="info">
  Branching is built using [Conditional Workflows](/concepts/conditional-workflows).
  See that page for full code examples covering parent conditions, event
  conditions, sleep conditions, or groups, and a complete branching workflow
  walkthrough.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  A task cancelled by `cancel_if` behaves like any other cancellation, and all
  downstream tasks are cancelled as well. Use `skip_if` when you want downstream
  tasks to still run and inspect the skip status.
</Callout>

## Use Cases

<Cards>
  <Cards.Card title="Feature Flag Routing" href="/concepts/conditional-workflows">
    Read a feature flag in an upstream task and route the workflow down
    different code paths based on its value.
  </Cards.Card>
  <Cards.Card
    title="Human-in-the-Loop Approval"
    href="/concepts/conditional-workflows"
  >
    Pause workflow execution until a human approves or rejects, then branch
    accordingly.
  </Cards.Card>
  <Cards.Card title="A/B Testing Pipelines" href="/concepts/conditional-workflows">
    Route data through different processing paths based on experiment
    assignment.
  </Cards.Card>
  <Cards.Card
    title="Error Recovery Branching"
    href="/concepts/conditional-workflows"
  >
    Branch into a fallback path when an upstream task signals a degraded state.
  </Cards.Card>

## Next Steps

- [Conditional Workflows](/concepts/conditional-workflows): full guide to conditions, or groups, and operators
- [DAG Workflows](/concepts/dags): define task dependencies that branching builds on
- [Fanout](/patterns/fanout): dynamically spawn tasks instead of choosing between fixed branches
- [Pre-Determined Pipelines](/patterns/pre-determined-pipelines): fixed-structure pipelines without branching
