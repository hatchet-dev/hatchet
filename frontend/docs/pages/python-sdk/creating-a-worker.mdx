# Creating a Worker

Workers can be created via the `hatchet.worker()` method, after instantiating a `hatchet` instance. It will automatically read in any `HATCHET_CLIENT` environment variables, which can be set in the process by using something like `dotenv`. For example:

```py
from hatchet_sdk import Hatchet
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

hatchet = Hatchet()

# workflow code...

worker = hatchet.worker('test-worker')
worker.register_workflow(workflow)

# worker.start() is blocking
worker.start()
```
