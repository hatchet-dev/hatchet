# Pushing Events

Events can be pushed via the client's `client.event.push` method:

```py
from hatchet import new_client

client = new_client()

client.event.push(
    "user:create",
    {
        "test": "test"
    }
)
```

Events should be JSON serializable, so should generally use a `dict` or a type that serializes into a JSON object.
