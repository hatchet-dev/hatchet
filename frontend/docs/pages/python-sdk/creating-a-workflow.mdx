# Creating a Workflow

To create a workflow, simply create a new class and use the `hatchet.workflow` and `hatchet.step` decorators to define the structure of your workflow. For example, a simple 2-step workflow would look like:

```py
from hatchet-sdk import Hatchet

hatchet = Hatchet()

@hatchet.workflow(on_events=["user:create"])
class MyWorkflow:
    @hatchet.step()
    def step1(self, context):
        print("executed step1")
        pass

    @hatchet.step(parents=["step1"])
    def step2(self, context):
        print("executed step2")
        pass
```

You'll notice that the workflow defines a workflow trigger (in this case, `on_events`), and the workflow definition. The workflow definition is a series of steps, which can be defined using the `hatchet.step` decorator. Each step must be a method on the class, and must accept a `context` argument. The `context` argument is a `Context` object, which contains information about the workflow, such as the input data and the output data of previous steps.

To create multi-step workflows, you can use `parents` to define the steps which the current step depends on. 

## Getting Access to the Input Data

You can get access to the workflow's input data, such as the event data or other specified input data, by using the `context.workflow_input()` method on the `context`. For example, given the following event:

```json
{
    "name": "test"
}
```

You can get access to the event data by doing the following:

```py
@hatchet.workflow(on_events=["user:create"])
class MyWorkflow:
    @hatchet.step()
    def step1(self, context : Context):
        print("executed step1", context.workflow_input())
        pass
```

## Step Outputs

Step outputs should be a `dict` and are optional. For example:

```py
@hatchet.workflow(on_events=["user:create"])
class MyWorkflow:
    @hatchet.step()
    def step1(self, context : Context):
        return {
            "step-1-output": "test"
        }
```

Future steps can access this output by calling `context.step_output("<step>")`. In this example, a future step could access this data via `context.step_output("step1")`.

## Cron Schedules

You can declare a cron schedule by passing `on_crons` to the `hatchet.workflow` decorator. For example, to trigger a workflow every 5 minutes, you can do the following:

```go
from hatchet-sdk import Hatchet

hatchet = Hatchet()

@hatchet.workflow(on_crons=["*/5 * * * *"])
class MyWorkflow:
    @hatchet.step()
    def step1(self, context):
        print("executed step1")
        pass

    @hatchet.step(parents=["step1"])
    def step2(self, context):
        print("executed step2")
        pass
```
