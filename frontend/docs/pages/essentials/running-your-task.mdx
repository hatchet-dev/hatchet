# Running Your First Task

With your task defined and a worker running, you can import the task wherever you need it and invoke it with the `run` method.

## Common trigger patterns

The two most common ways to run a task are:

- **[Run and wait](/concepts/run-with-results)** — call a task and block until you get the result back. Use this for synchronous workflows like fan-out, LLM calls, or any time you need the output before continuing.
- **[Fire and forget](/concepts/run-no-wait)** — enqueue a task without waiting for the result. Use this for background jobs like sending emails, processing uploads, or kicking off long-running pipelines.

## Where you can trigger from

You can trigger tasks in two main ways:

- **Same codebase or monorepo** — import your task and call `run`, `run_no_wait`, or other trigger methods directly. Your API server, CLI, or another service in the same repo can use the same task definition.
- **External API or separate service (polyrepo)** — when the triggering code can't import the task definition (different repo, language, or microservice), use a **stub**: a Hatchet task with the same name and input/output types but no implementation. See [Inter-Service Triggering](/concepts/inter-service-triggering) for details.
- **From the CLI** — use the `hatchet run` command to trigger tasks from the command line.
- **From the Dashboard** — use the Hatchet dashboard to trigger tasks from the web interface.

## Other trigger styles

Hatchet supports additional trigger patterns for more advanced use cases:

| Style         | Use case                                             | Doc                                           |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Scheduled** | Run once at a specific time in the future            | [Scheduled Trigger](/concepts/scheduled-runs) |
| **Cron**      | Run on a recurring schedule (daily, weekly, etc.)    | [Cron Trigger](/concepts/cron-runs)           |
| **Events**    | Run when an event is emitted (e.g. webhooks, queues) | [Event Trigger](/concepts/run-on-event)       |
| **Bulk**      | Run the same task many times with different inputs   | [Bulk Run Many](/concepts/bulk-run)           |
| **Webhooks**  | Let external systems trigger workflows via HTTP      | [Webhooks](/concepts/webhooks)                |

## Next steps

Now that you can run tasks, explore [Durable Workflows](/essentials/durable-workflows) to compose multiple tasks into pipelines with dependencies and checkpointing.
