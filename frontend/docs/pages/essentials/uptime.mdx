# Uptime and status

For Hatchet Cloud availability and incident updates, use the status page. For self-hosted deployments, availability depends on your own infrastructure.

## Hatchet Cloud status page

Use **[status.hatchet.run](https://status.hatchet.run/)** for real-time status and incident history for Hatchet Cloud and related services:

- **API**: Hatchet API availability
- **Hatchet Cloud**: `cloud.onhatchet.run`
- **Website**: `hatchet.run` and documentation sites

You can also subscribe to updates (email/SMS/etc.) directly from the status page.

## Self-hosted deployments

If you self-host Hatchet, you’re responsible for uptime, monitoring, backups, and upgrade procedures.

- **Deployment guidance**: [Self Hosting](/self-hosting)
- **Redundancy & failover**: [High Availability](/self-hosting/high-availability)
