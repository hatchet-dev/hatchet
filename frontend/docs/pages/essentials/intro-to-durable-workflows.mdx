# Intro to Durable Workflows

A **durable workflow** is work whose execution state lives in Hatchet, not in your process. If a worker crashes, scales down, or deploys, Hatchet resumes from the last checkpoint instead of starting over.

Hatchet supports two patterns. Both are durable; the difference is whether you know the **shape of work** ahead of time.

**Durable Task Execution** — a single long-running function that checkpoints its progress. Use when the work is dynamic: IO waits, runtime fan-out, loops, or agent-style reasoning.

**DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)** — a set of tasks connected by declared dependencies. Use when the shape of work is known upfront: pipelines, multi-step processing, branching logic.
