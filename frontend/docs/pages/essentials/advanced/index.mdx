# Advanced Setup

<Callout type="info">
  This guide is intended for users who want to explore Hatchet in more depth
  beyond the quickstart. If you haven't already set up Hatchet, please see the
  [Hatchet Cloud Quickstart](/essentials/quickstart) or the [Self-Hosting
  Quickstart](/self-hosting) first.
</Callout>

## Set environment variables

All Hatchet SDKs require the `HATCHET_CLIENT_TOKEN` environment variable to be set. This token is automatically created when you run a CLI command like `hatchet worker dev` or `hatchet trigger`, but if you're setting up a project manually, you'll need to set this variable yourself. You can generate an API token from the Hatchet frontend by navigating to the `Settings` tab and clicking on the `API Tokens` tab. Click the `Generate API Token` button to create a new token. Set this environment variable in your project, and **do not share it publicly**.

```bash copy
export HATCHET_CLIENT_TOKEN="<your-client-token>"
```

Additionally, if you are a self-hosted user provisioning without TLS enabled, you will need to set the `HATCHET_CLIENT_TLS_STRATEGY` environment variable to `none`. If you are on Hatchet Cloud, TLS is enabled by default, so this is not required.

```bash copy
export HATCHET_CLIENT_TLS_STRATEGY=none
```
