# Security

This page points you to Hatchet's security resources and highlights the most important security considerations for Hatchet Cloud and self-hosted deployments.

## Trust center

Hatchet is SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA, and GDPR compliant. Company-level security practices, compliance reports, and security documentation are available at the **[Hatchet Trust Center](https://trust.hatchet.run/)**.

## Same source, same security

Hatchet Cloud and self-hosted Hatchet run the same codebase. The open source project is 100% MIT licensed and undergoes regular third-party penetration testing. Findings are remediated across both deployment models, so security improvements benefit all users equally.

## Hatchet Cloud

Hatchet Cloud is Hatchet's managed service:

- **Encryption in transit**: all API and worker traffic is encrypted with TLS. gRPC connections between workers and the engine use TLS by default.
- **Encryption at rest**: data stored in Hatchet Cloud is encrypted at rest.
- **Tenant isolation**: each tenant's data is logically isolated. Requests are authenticated and scoped to a single tenant.
- **Authentication**: API tokens are scoped per-tenant with configurable expiration. The dashboard supports SSO via Google, GitHub, and more coming soon.
- **Penetration testing**: Hatchet Cloud is regularly tested by independent security firms. Findings are tracked and remediated on a defined timeline.
- **Infrastructure**: Hatchet Cloud runs on AWS with private networking, automated patching, and centralized logging.

For the definitive controls, policies, and compliance reports, refer to the **[Hatchet Trust Center](https://trust.hatchet.run/)**.

## Self-hosted

When you self-host Hatchet, your security posture depends on how you deploy and operate the Hatchet services and their dependencies. A practical baseline:

- **Put TLS in front of the API**: terminate TLS at your ingress/load balancer (or directly on the API) and only expose it to the networks that need it.
- **Treat tokens and DB credentials as secrets**: use a secrets manager and rotate credentials; avoid committing secrets into git or baking them into images.
- **Limit network reachability**: restrict access to the Hatchet API and PostgreSQL to trusted networks (VPC, private subnets, or Kubernetes network policies).
- **Use least privilege**: run Hatchet with the minimum DB permissions needed; don't reuse "admin" DB credentials.
- **Stay current**: keep Hatchet and dependencies up to date to pick up security fixes.
