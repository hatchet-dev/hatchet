# Quickstart

> Note: this guide is written for Go developers. We have more SDKs on the roadmap, please [get in touch](mailto:contact@hatchet.run) if you would like to be notified when they're available (or you'd like to help us build one!).

## Prerequisites

This quickstart example requires the following tools to work:

- `go 1.18+`
- [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [`caddy`](https://caddyserver.com/docs/install)

## Hatchet Instance Setup

1. Clone the quickstart repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/hatchet-dev/hatchet-go-quickstart.git && cd hatchet-go-quickstart
   ```

2. Run `go mod download` to fetch all packages.

3. Run `docker compose up` to start the Hatchet instance. This will take a few minutes, as the docker compose services set up the database and generate the required certificates to connect to the Hatchet instance. You can also run `docker compose up -d` to start this in the background. Once you start to see output from the `engine` and `api` services, you can move on to the next step.

4. Run `caddy start` to get an instance running. You should be able to navigate to [app.dev.hatchet-tools.com](https://app.dev.hatchet-tools.com) and use the following credentials to log in:

   ```
   Email: admin@example.com
   Password: Admin123!!
   ```

5. Create the required environment variables via:

   ```sh
   cat > .env <<EOF
   HATCHET_CLIENT_TENANT_ID=707d0855-80ab-4e1f-a156-f1c4546cbf52
   HATCHET_CLIENT_TLS_ROOT_CA_FILE=./certs/ca.cert
   HATCHET_CLIENT_TLS_CERT_FILE=./certs/client-worker.pem
   HATCHET_CLIENT_TLS_KEY_FILE=./certs/client-worker.key
   HATCHET_CLIENT_TLS_SERVER_NAME=cluster
   EOF
   ```

6. Run the server and worker in two separate shell sessions via: `go run ./cmd/server` and `go run ./cmd/worker`.

7. Run `curl http://localhost:1323/test` to test the endpoint. You will see events and workflows populated in the Hatchet dashboard:

   />

## Explanation

### Server

The server is a simple HTTP server that exposes a single endpoint at `/test`. When this endpoint is hit, it will create a new workflow and uses the Hatchet events API to send an event to Hatchet.

```go filename="server.go" copy
hatchetClient.Event().Push(
  context.Background(),
  "test-called",
  &events.TestEvent{
    Name: "testing",
  },
)
```

### Worker

The worker is a simple worker that listens for events with the key `test-called` from Hatchet. When an event is received, it will print the event to the console.

```go filename="worker.go" copy
w.On(worker.Event("test-called"), &worker.WorkflowJob{
  Name:        "event-test",
  Description: "Test workflow.",
  Timeout:     "60s",
  Steps: []*worker.WorkflowStep{
    {
      Function: func(ctx context.Context, event *events.TestEvent) error {
        fmt.Println("got event: ", event.Name)
        return nil
      },
    },
  },
})
```

## Next Steps

Hatchet has many powerful features that can be used to build complex workflows. Check out the [Go SDK](./go-sdk) for more information.
