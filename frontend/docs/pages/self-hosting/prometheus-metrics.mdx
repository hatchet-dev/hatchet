## Prometheus Metrics for Hatchet

<Callout type="warning">Only works with v1 tenants</Callout>

This document provides an overview of the Prometheus metrics exposed by Hatchet, setup instructions for the metrics endpoint, and example PromQL queries to analyze them.

### Setup

To enable and configure the Prometheus metrics endpoint in your Hatchet server, set the following environment variables (bound to Viper keys as shown):

- **`SERVER_PROMETHEUS_ENABLED`** (`prometheus.enabled`)

  - Type: boolean
  - Default: `false`
  - Description: Enables or disables the Prometheus metrics HTTP server.

- **`SERVER_PROMETHEUS_ADDRESS`** (`prometheus.address`)

  - Type: string
  - Default: `":9090"`
  - Description: The network address and port to bind the Prometheus metrics server to.

- **`SERVER_PROMETHEUS_PATH`** (`prometheus.path`)
  - Type: string
  - Default: `"/metrics"`
  - Description: The HTTP path at which metrics will be exposed.

If you have set up a Prometheus instance to scrape Hatchet metrics, you can enable the [tenant API endpoint](/home/prometheus-metrics) by setting the following variables:

- **`SERVER_PROMETHEUS_SERVER_URL`** (`prometheus.prometheusServerURL`)

  - Type: string
  - Description: The Prometheus server URL.

- **`SERVER_PROMETHEUS_SERVER_USERNAME`** (`prometheus.prometheusServerUsername`)

  - Type: string
  - Description: The username to access the Prometheus instance via HTTP basic auth.

- **`SERVER_PROMETHEUS_SERVER_PASSWORD`** (`prometheus.prometheusServerPassword`)

  - Type: string
  - Description: The password to access the Prometheus instance via HTTP basic auth.

**Example environment setup:**

```bash
export SERVER_PROMETHEUS_ENABLED=true
export SERVER_PROMETHEUS_ADDRESS=":9999"
export SERVER_PROMETHEUS_PATH="/custom-metrics"
```

Restart your Hatchet server after setting these variables to apply the changes.

### Integration with Prometheus

This endpoint can be used to configure Prometheus to scrape tenant-specific metrics:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "hatchet-tenant-metrics"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["cloud.onhatchet.run"]
    metrics_path: "/api/v1/tenants/707d0855-80ab-4e1f-a156-f1c4546cbf52/prometheus-metrics"
    scheme: "https"
    authorization:
      credentials: "your-api-token-here"
```

**Note:** Replace `cloud.onhatchet.run` with the URL where your Hatchet instance is hosted.

This provides tenant-isolated metrics that can be scraped directly by Prometheus or consumed by other monitoring tools that support the Prometheus text format.
