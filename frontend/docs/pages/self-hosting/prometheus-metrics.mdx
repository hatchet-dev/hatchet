## Prometheus Metrics for Hatchet

This document provides an overview of the Prometheus metrics exposed by Hatchet, setup instructions for the metrics endpoint, and example PromQL queries to analyze them.

### Setup

To enable and configure the Prometheus metrics endpoint in your Hatchet server, set the following environment variables (bound to Viper keys as shown):

- **`SERVER_PROMETHEUS_ENABLED`** (`prometheus.enabled`)

  - Type: boolean
  - Default: `false`
  - Description: Enables or disables the Prometheus metrics HTTP server.

- **`SERVER_PROMETHEUS_ADDRESS`** (`prometheus.address`)

  - Type: string
  - Default: `":9090"`
  - Description: The network address and port to bind the Prometheus metrics server to.

- **`SERVER_PROMETHEUS_PATH`** (`prometheus.path`)
  - Type: string
  - Default: `"/metrics"`
  - Description: The HTTP path at which metrics will be exposed.

If you have set up a Prometheus instance to scrape Hatchet metrics, you can enable the [tenant API endpoint](/home/prometheus-metrics) by setting the following variables:

- **`SERVER_PROMETHEUS_SERVER_ADDRESS`** (`prometheus.prometheusServerAddress`)

  - Type: string
  - Description: The Prometheus server address.

- **`SERVER_PROMETHEUS_SERVER_USERNAME`** (`prometheus.prometheusServerUsername`)

  - Type: string
  - Description: The username to access the Prometheus instance via HTTP basic auth.

- **`SERVER_PROMETHEUS_SERVER_PASSWORD`** (`prometheus.prometheusServerPassword`)

  - Type: string
  - Description: The password to access the Prometheus instance via HTTP basic auth.

**Example environment setup:**

```bash
export SERVER_PROMETHEUS_ENABLED=true
export SERVER_PROMETHEUS_ADDRESS=":9999"
export SERVER_PROMETHEUS_PATH="/custom-metrics"
```

Restart your Hatchet server after setting these variables to apply the changes.

| Metric Name                          | Type      | Description                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------ | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hatchet_queue_invocations_total`    | Counter   | The total number of invocations of the queuer function                            |
| `hatchet_created_tasks_total`        | Counter   | The total number of tasks created                                                 |
| `hatchet_retried_tasks_total`        | Counter   | The total number of tasks retried                                                 |
| `hatchet_succeeded_tasks_total`      | Counter   | The total number of tasks that succeeded                                          |
| `hatchet_failed_tasks_total`         | Counter   | The total number of tasks that failed (in a final state, not including retries)   |
| `hatchet_skipped_tasks_total`        | Counter   | The total number of tasks that were skipped                                       |
| `hatchet_cancelled_tasks_total`      | Counter   | The total number of tasks cancelled                                               |

### Tenant Metrics

| Metric Name                          | Type      | Description                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------ | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hatchet_workflow_duration_milliseconds` | Histogram | Duration of workflow execution in milliseconds (DAGs and single tasks) |
| `hatchet_assigned_tasks`             | Counter   | The total number of tasks assigned to a worker |
| `hatchet_scheduling_timed_out`       | Counter   | The total number of tasks that timed out while waiting to be scheduled |
| `hatchet_rate_limited`               | Counter   | The total number of tasks that were rate limited |
| `hatchet_queued_to_assigned`         | Counter   | The total number of unique tasks that were queued and later got assigned to a worker |
| `hatchet_queued_to_assigned_time_seconds` | Histogram | Buckets of time in seconds spent in the queue before being assigned to a worker |

### Example PromQL Queries

#### 1. Rate of calls to the queuer method

```promql
rate(hatchet_queue_invocations_total[5m])
```

#### 2. Average queue time in milliseconds

```promql
# Calculates average queue time over the past 5 minutes, converted to ms
rate(hatchet_queued_to_assigned_seconds_sum[5m])
  / rate(hatchet_queued_to_assigned_seconds_count[5m])
  * 1e3
```

#### 3. Success and failure rates

```promql
rate(hatchet_succeeded_tasks_total[5m])
rate(hatchet_failed_tasks_total[5m])
```

#### 4. Queue time distribution (histogram)

```promql
sum by (le) (
  rate(hatchet_queued_to_assigned_seconds_bucket[5m])
)
```

#### 5. Rate of tasks created vs. retried

```promql
rate(hatchet_created_tasks_total[5m])
rate(hatchet_retried_tasks_total[5m])
```

### Integration with Prometheus

This endpoint can be used to configure Prometheus to scrape tenant-specific metrics:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "hatchet-tenant-metrics"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["cloud.onhatchet.run"]
    metrics_path: "/api/v1/tenants/707d0855-80ab-4e1f-a156-f1c4546cbf52/prometheus-metrics"
    scheme: "https"
    authorization:
      credentials: "your-api-token-here"
```

**Note:** Replace `cloud.onhatchet.run` with the URL where your Hatchet instance is hosted.

This provides tenant-isolated metrics that can be scraped directly by Prometheus or consumed by other monitoring tools that support the Prometheus text format.
