## Prometheus Metrics for Hatchet

This document provides an overview of the Prometheus metrics exposed by Hatchet, setup instructions for the metrics endpoint, and example PromQL queries to analyze them.

### Setup

To enable and configure the Prometheus metrics endpoint in your Hatchet server, set the following environment variables (bound to Viper keys as shown):

- **`SERVER_PROMETHEUS_ENABLED`** (`prometheus.enabled`)

  - Type: boolean
  - Default: `false`
  - Description: Enables or disables the Prometheus metrics HTTP server.

- **`SERVER_PROMETHEUS_ADDRESS`** (`prometheus.address`)

  - Type: string
  - Default: `":9090"`
  - Description: The network address and port to bind the Prometheus metrics server to.

- **`SERVER_PROMETHEUS_PATH`** (`prometheus.path`)
  - Type: string
  - Default: `"/metrics"`
  - Description: The HTTP path at which metrics will be exposed.

**Example environment setup:**

```bash
export SERVER_PROMETHEUS_ENABLED=true
export SERVER_PROMETHEUS_ADDRESS=":9999"
export SERVER_PROMETHEUS_PATH="/custom-metrics"
```

Restart your Hatchet server after setting these variables to apply the changes.

### Metrics

| Metric Name                          | Type      | Description                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------ | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hatchet_queue_invocations_total`    | Counter   | The total number of invocations of the queuer function                            |
| `hatchet_created_tasks_total`        | Counter   | The total number of tasks created                                                 |
| `hatchet_retried_tasks_total`        | Counter   | The total number of tasks retried                                                 |
| `hatchet_succeeded_tasks_total`      | Counter   | The total number of tasks that succeeded                                          |
| `hatchet_failed_tasks_total`         | Counter   | The total number of tasks that failed (in a final state, not including retries)   |
| `hatchet_skipped_tasks_total`        | Counter   | The total number of tasks that were skipped                                       |
| `hatchet_cancelled_tasks_total`      | Counter   | The total number of tasks cancelled                                               |
| `hatchet_assigned_tasks_total`       | Counter   | The total number of tasks assigned to a worker                                    |
| `hatchet_scheduling_timed_out_total` | Counter   | The total number of tasks that timed out while waiting to be scheduled            |
| `hatchet_rate_limited_total`         | Counter   | The total number of tasks that were rate limited                                  |
| `hatchet_queued_to_assigned_total`   | Counter   | The total number of unique tasks that were queued and later assigned to a worker  |
| `hatchet_queued_to_assigned_seconds` | Histogram | Buckets of time (in seconds) spent in the queue before being assigned to a worker |

### Example PromQL Queries

#### 1. Rate of calls to the queuer method

```promql
rate(hatchet_queue_invocations_total[5m])
```

#### 2. Average queue time in milliseconds

```promql
# Calculates average queue time over the past 5 minutes, converted to ms
rate(hatchet_queued_to_assigned_seconds_sum[5m])
  / rate(hatchet_queued_to_assigned_seconds_count[5m])
  * 1e3
```

#### 3. Success and failure rates

```promql
rate(hatchet_succeeded_tasks_total[5m])
rate(hatchet_failed_tasks_total[5m])
```

#### 4. Queue time distribution (histogram)

```promql
sum by (le) (
  rate(hatchet_queued_to_assigned_seconds_bucket[5m])
)
```

#### 5. Rate of tasks created vs. retried

```promql
rate(hatchet_created_tasks_total[5m])
rate(hatchet_retried_tasks_total[5m])
```
