# Github App Setup

You can configure a Github app to integrate Hatchet with your Github repositories.

### Github App Creation

To create a Github app that can read from your repositories, navigate to your organization settings page (alternately, you can navigate to your personal settings page) and select **Developer Settings** in the sidebar. Go to **Github Apps** and select **New Github App**. You should use the following settings:

- Homepage URL: you can set this as https://hatchet.run, or some other domain for your organization.
- Callback URL: `<protocol>://<your-domain>/api/v1/users/github/callback`
- The **Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation** checkbox should be checked.
- Webhook URL: `<protocol>://<your-domain>/api/v1/github/webhook`
- Webhook secret: generate a random webhook secret for your domain, for example by running `cat /dev/urandom | base64 | head -c 32`. **Make note of this secret, as you will need it later**.
- Permissions:
  - **Repository:**
    - **Checks (Read & write)**: required to write Github checks for each commit/PR.
    - **Contents (Read):** required for Hatchet to read files from the repository.
    - **Metadata (Read-only):** mandatory, required for Github apps that integrate with repositories.
    - **Pull Requests (Read & write):** required for Hatchet to add comments to Github PRs, and to create PRs.
    - **Webhooks (Read & write):** required for Hatchet to create a Github repository webhooks that notify the Hatchet instance when PRs are updated.
  - **Account:**
    - **Email addresses (read-only)**: required for Hatchet to read your Github email address for authentication.

### Creating a Secret and Private Key

After creating the Github App, create the following:

- In the "Client secrets" section, select **Generate a new client secret**. You will need this secret in the following section.
- In the "Private keys" section, download a new private key for your app. You will need this private key in the following section.

### Private Keys and Environment Variables

After creating the private key, you can place it somewhere in your filesystem and set the `SERVER_VCS_GITHUB_APP_SECRET_PATH` environment variable to the path of the private key.

Make sure the following environment variables are set:

```txt
SERVER_VCS_KIND=github
SERVER_VCS_GITHUB_ENABLED=true
SERVER_VCS_GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID=<client-id>
SERVER_VCS_GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET=<client-secret>
SERVER_VCS_GITHUB_APP_NAME=<app-name>
SERVER_VCS_GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<webhook-secret>
SERVER_VCS_GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_URL=<webhook-url>
SERVER_VCS_GITHUB_APP_ID=<app-id>
SERVER_VCS_GITHUB_APP_SECRET_PATH=<path-to-pem-file>
```

Once these are set, you should now be able to configure your workflows to use these Github settings.
