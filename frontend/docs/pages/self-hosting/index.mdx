# Self-Hosting the Hatchet Control Plane

Self-hosting Hatchet means running your own instance of the **Hatchet Control Plane** - the central orchestration system that manages workflows, schedules tasks, and coordinates worker execution. This is different from running workers, which can connect to any Hatchet instance (self-hosted or Hatchet Cloud).

## What You're Self-Hosting

When you self-host Hatchet, you're deploying:

- **API Server** - REST and gRPC APIs for workflow management
- **Engine** - Core workflow orchestration and task scheduling
- **Database** - PostgreSQL for storing workflow state and metadata
- **Message Queue (optional)** - RabbitMQ for inter-service communication and high-throughput real-time updates
- **Dashboard** - Web UI for monitoring workflows and debugging

Your **workers** (the processes that execute your workflow steps) will connect to your self-hosted control plane and execute tasks.

## Deployment Options

There are currently three supported ways to self-host the Hatchet Control Plane:

Docker:

1. [Hatchet Lite](./self-hosting/hatchet-lite.mdx) - Single docker image with embedded SQLite (development, testing, or low-throughput production)
2. [Docker Compose](./self-hosting/docker-compose.mdx) - Multi-container setup with PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ (production)

Kubernetes:

1. [Quickstart with Helm](./self-hosting/kubernetes-quickstart.mdx) - Production-ready Helm charts (production)
