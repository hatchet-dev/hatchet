# Data Retention

In Hatchet engine version `0.36.0` and above, you can configure the default data retention per tenant for workflow runs and events. The default value is set to 30 days, which means that all workflow runs which were created over 30 days ago and are in a final state (i.e. completed or failed), and all events which were created over 30 days ago, will be deleted.

This can be configured by setting the following environment variable to a Go duration string:

```sh
SERVER_LIMITS_DEFAULT_TENANT_RETENTION_PERIOD=720h # 30 days
```
