# High Availability

If you are running Hatchet in a high-throughput production environment, you may want to set up an HA (High Availability) configuration to ensure that your system remains available in the event of infrastructure failures or other issues.

There are multiple levels that you can configure Hatchet to be high availability:

- At the **database level** by using a managed Postgres provider like AWS RDS or Google Cloud SQL which supports HA options.
- At the **RabbitMQ level** by configuring the RabbitMQ cluster to have at least 3 replicas across multiple zones within a region.
- At the **Hatchet Engine/API level** by running multiple instances of the Hatchet engine behind a load balancer and splitting the different Hatchet services into separate deployments.

This guide will focus on the last level of high availability.

To view an end-to-end example of configuring Hatchet for high availability on GCP using Terraform, check out the GCP deployment guide [here](github.com/hatchet-dev/hatchet-infra-examples/blob/main/self-hosting/gcp)

## HA Helm Chart

Hatchet offers an HA Helm chart that can be used to deploy Hatchet in a high availability configuration. To use this Helm chart:

```sh
helm repo add hatchet https://hatchet-dev.github.io/hatchet-charts
helm install hatchet-ha hatchet/hatchet-ha
```

This chart accepts the same parameters as `hatchet-stack` for the top-level `api`, `frontend`, `postgres` and `rabbitmq` objects, but you can additionally configure the following services:

```yaml
grpc:
  replicaCount: 4
controllers:
  replicaCount: 2
scheduler:
  replicaCount: 2
```

See the [Helm configuration](./kubernetes-helm-configuration) guide for more information on configuring the Hatchet Helm charts.
