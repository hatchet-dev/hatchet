# Managing Environments with Hatchet

## Multiple Developers, One Orchestrator

When multiple developers share a single Hatchet orchestrator, conflicts can arise as workflow runs and events intermingle. Without proper isolation, one developer's workflows might interfere with another's testing or development work.

Hatchet provides three key solutions for managing this challenge: namespaces, multi-tenancy, and a local Hatchet instance.

### Solution 1: Namespaces (Beta)

Namespaces provide isolation within a single tenant, allowing multiple developers to work simultaneously without conflicts.

1. **Set a unique namespace** for each developer:

```bash
export HATCHET_CLIENT_NAMESPACE="dev-alice"
```

2. With unique namespaces, developers can work independently:
   - Workflows only trigger for the namespace that created them
   - Events remain isolated to their originating namespace
   - Workers only process jobs from their assigned namespace

> Note: Namespaces are currently in beta with limited UI support.

### Solution 2: Multi-Tenancy

For stronger isolation, create separate tenants for each developer or environment:

  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowFullScreen
/>

1. Access the tenant dropdown in the dashboard (bottom left)
2. Select "Add New Tenant" and provide a descriptive name
3. Generate a new token for that tenant
4. Each developer configures their environment with their designated tenant token


### Solution 3: Local Hatchet Instance

If you are using Hatchet locally, you can create a local instance of Hatchet to manage your isolated local development environment. Follow instructions [here](../self-hosting/hatchet-lite.mdx) to get started.


### Recommended Setups

**For Development Teams:**
- **Small teams:** Use namespaces within a shared development tenant
- **Larger teams:** Leverage local hatchet instances to create separate tenants for each developer
- **Production/staging:** Use dedicated tenants with controlled access

**Implementation Example:**
```
Dev Team Setup:
- Central Hatchet Instance
  ├── Tenant: development
  │   ├── Namespace: dev-alice
  │   ├── Namespace: dev-bob  
  │   └── Namespace: dev-charlie
  ├── Tenant: staging
  └── Tenant: production
```

## Best Practices

- **Unique Identifiers:** Use consistent, unique identifiers for namespaces and tenants
- **Environment Variables:** Set namespace variables in your local environment or .env files
- **Token Security:** Treat tenant tokens as sensitive data and avoid sharing them
- **Coordination:** Establish naming conventions and communicate among team members to avoid conflicts
