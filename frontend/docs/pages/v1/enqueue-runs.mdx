# Enqueuing a Workflow Run (Fire and Forget)

> This example assumes we have a [workflow](./basic-workflows.mdx) registered on a running [worker](./workers.mdx).

Often times you may want to run a workflow without waiting for it to complete. This pattern, often referred to as "fire and forget", is useful for workflows that take a long time to complete or are not critical to the immediate operation of your application.

<UniversalTabs items={["Python", "Typescript", "Go"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab title="Python">
    You can use your `Workflow` object to run a workflow and "forget" it by calling the `run_no_wait` method. This method enqueue a workflow run and return a `WorkflowRunRef`, a reference to that run, without waiting for the result.

  ```python
  from src.workflows import my_workflow, MyWorkflowInputModel

  ref = my_workflow.run_no_wait(MyWorkflowInputModel(foo="bar"))
  ```

  You can also `await` the result of `aio_run_no_wait`:

  ```python
  ref = await my_workflow.aio_run_no_wait(input=MyWorkflowInputModel(foo="bar"))
  ```

  Note that the type of `input` here is a Pydantic model that matches the input schema of your workflow.

## Subscribing to results from an enqueued workflow

Often is is useful to subscribe to the results of a workflow at a later time. The `run_no_wait` method returns a `WorkflowRunRef` object which includes a listener for the result of the workflow.

<UniversalTabs items={["Python", "Typescript", "Go"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab title="Python">

  Use `ref.result()` to block until the result is available:

   ```python
  result = ref.result()
  ```

  or await `aio_result`:

  ```python
  result = await ref.aio_result()
  ```

## Triggering Runs in the Hatchet Dashboard

In the Hatchet Dashboard, you can trigger and view runs for your workflows.

Navigate to "Workflow Runs" in the left sidebar and click "Trigger Run" at the top right.

You can specify run parameters such as Input, Additional Metadata, and the Scheduled Time.
