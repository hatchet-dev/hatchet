# Enqueuing a Workflow (Fire and Forget)

> This example assumes we have a [workflow](./basic-workflows.mdx) registered on a running [worker](./workers.mdx).

Often times you may want to run a workflow without waiting for it to complete. This pattern, often referred to as "fire and forget", is useful for workflows that take a long time to complete or are not critical to the immediate operation of your application.

## Subscribing to results from an enqueued workflow

Often is is useful to subscribe to the results of a workflow at a later time. The enqueue method returns a `WorkflowRunRef` object which includes a listener for the result of the workflow. 

You can also re-establish a `WorkflowRunRef` from a runId at a later time using the `runRef` method.
