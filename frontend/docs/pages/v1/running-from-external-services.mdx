# Running from External Services

Hatchet allows you to run workflows from external services. This is useful when you need to trigger a workflow from an external service, such as an API, or triggering workflows across multiple languages (i.e. Python, Typescript, Go).

There are three ways to run workflows from external services:

1. [Creating a Workflow Declaration Stub](#creating-a-workflow-declaration-stub)
2. [Client Run Methods](#client-run-methods)
3. [Event Pushing](#event-pushing)

## Creating a Workflow Declaration Stub

The recommended way to run workflows from external services is to create a workflow declaration stub. A workflow declaration stub is the minimal amount of code needed to declare a workflow that matches the declaration on the worker (i.e. name and input/output types).

The resulting stub exposes the same run methods as the workflow declaration on the worker (i.e. `run`, `enqueue`, `schedule`, etc).

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab title="Go">TODO V1 DOCS</Tabs.Tab>
</UniversalTabs>

  Note: In a single-language monorepo, you can share a full workflow declaration between the worker and the external service. 
  Take care on the external service not to add tasks or modify the workflow in a way that would break the stub.
</Callout>


## Client Run Methods

The client exposes the same run methods as the workflow declaration on the worker, but can be called with just the workflow name and an untyped input.

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab title="Go">TODO V1 DOCS</Tabs.Tab>
</UniversalTabs>

## Event Pushing

[Event pushing](./run-on-event.mdx) is a way to trigger workflows which have registered an [`on_event` trigger](./run-on-event.mdx) from external services without needing any of the workflow structure. It is useful when you need to trigger multiple workflows from an external service.
