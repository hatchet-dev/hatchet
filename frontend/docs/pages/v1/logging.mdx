# Logging

Hatchet comes with a built-in logging view where you can push debug logs from your workflows. This is useful for debugging and monitoring your workflows.

  <Tabs.Tab>
You can use either Python's built-in `logging` package, or the `context.log` method for more control over the logs that are sent.

## Using the built-in `logging` package

You can pass a custom logger to the `Hatchet` class when initializing it. For example:

<GithubSnippet src={LoggerClientPy} target="RootLogger" />

It's recommended that you pass the root logger to the `Hatchet` class, as this will ensure that all logs are captured by the Hatchet logger. If you have workflows defined in multiple files, they should be children of the root logger. For example, with the following file structure:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.File name="client.py" />
  <FileTree.File name="worker.py" />
  <FileTree.Folder name="workflows" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="workflow.py" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

You should pass the root logger to the `Hatchet` class in `client.py`:

<GithubSnippet src={LoggerClientPy} target="RootLogger" />

And then in `workflows/workflow.py`, you should create a child logger:

<GithubSnippet src={LoggerWorkflowPy} target="LoggingWorkflow" />

## Using the `context.log` method

You can also use the `context.log` method to log messages from your workflows. This method is available on the `Context` object that is passed to each step in your workflow. For example:

<GithubSnippet src={LoggerWorkflowPy} target="ContextLogger" />

Each step is currently limited to 1000 log lines.
