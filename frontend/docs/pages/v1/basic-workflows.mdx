# Declaring Workflow Code

In Hatchet the fundamental unit of invocable work is a [Workflow](#defining-a-workflow) which is a collection of [Tasks](#defining-a-task) which are atomic functions. The simplest workflow can be a single task.

As we continue to build with Hatchet, we'll add additional configuration options to the workflow and task objects to support more complex workflows.

## Defining a Workflow

Start by declaring a workflow with a name. The workflow object can declare additional workflow-level configuration options which we'll cover later.

The returned object is an instance of the `Workflow` class which is the primary interface for interacting with the workflow (i.e. [running](./run-with-results.mdx), [enqueuing](./fire-and-forget.mdx), [scheduling](./scheduled-runs.mdx), etc).

      Declaring input and output types are optional, but recommended. 
      
      When declaring output types, the keys of the object will be the names of the steps in the workflow where the output will be returned.

## Defining a Task

Now that we have a workflow, we can define a task to be executed as part of the workflow. Tasks are defined by calling the `task` method on the workflow object. 

The `task` method takes a name and a function that defines the task's behavior. The function will receive the workflow's input and return the task's output.

    The `fn` argument is a function that takes the workflow's input and a context object. The context object contains information about the workflow run (e.g. the run ID, the workflow's input, etc). It can be synchronous or asynchronous.
