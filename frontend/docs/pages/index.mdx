# Introduction

Welcome to the Hatchet documentation! Hatchet is a self-hostable workflow engine built for application developers. 

**What is a workflow?**

The term `workflow` tends to be overloaded, so let's make things more clear - in Hatchet, a workflow is a set of functions which are executed in response to an external trigger (an event, schedule, or API call). For example, if you'd like to send notifications to a user after they've signed up, you could create a workflow for that.

**Why is that useful?**

Instead of processing background tasks and functions in your application handlers, which can lead to complex code, hard-to-debug errors, and resource contention, you can distribute these workflows between a set of `workers`. Workers are long-running processes which listen for events, and execute the functions defined in your workflows.

**What is a workflow engine?**

A workflow engine orchestrates the execution of workflows. It schedules workflows on workers, retries failed workflows, and provides integrations for monitoring and debugging workflows.

## Project Goals

Hatchet has the following high-level goals:

1. **Serve application developers:** we aim to support a broad set of languages and frameworks, to make it easier to support your existing applications. We currently support a Go SDK, with more languages coming soon.
2. **Simple to setup:** we've seen too many overengineered stacks built on a fragile task queue with overly complex infrastructure. Hatchet is designed to be simple to setup, run locally, and deploy to your own infrastructure.
3. **Flexibility when you need it:** as your application grows, you can use Hatchet to support complex, multi-step distributed workflows. Hatchet's backend is modular, allowing for customizing the implementation of the event storage API, queueing system, authentication, and more.

## Features

We currently support the following features, with many more on the roadmap:

- **Declarative workflows:** define workflows which run when events occur, with support for timeouts, multi-step workflows, and parallel execution:

    ```go filename="worker.go" {3} copy
    w.On(
        worker.Event("event:test"), 
        &worker.WorkflowJob{
            Name:        "example-workflow",
            Description: "Example workflow.",
            Timeout:     "60s",
            Steps: []worker.WorkflowStep{
                {
                    Function: func(ctx context.Context, event *events.TestEvent) error {
                        fmt.Println("got event: ", event.Name)
                        return nil
                    },
                },
            },
        },
    )
    ```

- **Event storage API:** store events in a durable event log, with support for querying and filtering events:

- **Web platform for visibility and monitoring**: view the status of your workflows, and drill down into individual events:
