# Durable Workflows

<Callout type="info">
  Just getting started? Check out the [essentials guide](/essentials/durable-workflows) for an introduction to durable workflows and when to use each pattern.
</Callout>

A **durable workflow** is work whose execution state lives in Hatchet instead of in your process. When you run a durable workflow, the orchestrator owns that state: it records progress, survives your worker crashing or scaling down, and resumes from the last checkpoint so work is not lost or duplicated.

Hatchet supports two patterns for building durable workflows, and you can mix them within the same application.

**Durable task execution** — A single long-running task that uses a durable context (`SleepFor`, `WaitForEvent`, `Memo`, etc.). Progress is checkpointed as the task runs. Best when you need procedural control flow, long waits, or human-in-the-loop inside one task.

**Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)** — Workflows made of multiple tasks with declared dependencies. Each task runs to completion; the graph structure and task outputs are the durable state. Best when your workflow is a fixed or mostly fixed graph of steps.

## How workflows relate to tasks

A workflow is triggered and observed the same way as a standalone task — `run`, `run_no_wait`, `schedule`, and the other trigger methods all work identically. The difference is that triggering a workflow enqueues its constituent tasks according to the dependency graph rather than running a single function.

Each task inside a workflow can access the outputs of its parent tasks through the context object, so data flows naturally from one step to the next.

## Configuration

Workflow-level configuration (like concurrency or on-failure hooks) applies across all tasks in the workflow. Individual tasks can still carry their own retry policies, timeouts, and other settings, which override or extend the workflow-level defaults.

| Concept | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| [Concurrency](/concepts/concurrency) | Limit concurrent runs of the entire workflow. |
| [On-failure tasks](/concepts/durable-workflows/directed-acyclic-graphs/on-failure-tasks) | Run a cleanup task when any task in the workflow fails. |
| [Conditional workflows](/concepts/durable-workflows/directed-acyclic-graphs/conditional-workflows) | Skip or gate tasks based on runtime conditions. |
