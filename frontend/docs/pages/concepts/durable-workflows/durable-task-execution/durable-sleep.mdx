## Durable Sleep

Durable sleep is a feature of **durable tasks** which pauses execution for a specified amount of time. When a task calls durable sleep, it is [evicted](/concepts/durable-workflows/durable-task-execution/task-eviction) from the worker — freeing the slot — and re-queued when the sleep expires.

Unlike a regular `sleep`, durable sleep is guaranteed to respect the original duration across interruptions. For example, say you'd like to send a notification to a user after 24 hours. With a regular `sleep`, if the task is interrupted after 23 hours, it will restart and call `sleep` for 24 hours again — sleeping 47 hours total. With durable sleep, the task will only sleep for 1 more hour on restart.

## Using durable sleep

Durable sleep can be used by calling the `SleepFor` method on the `DurableContext` object. This method takes a duration as an argument and will sleep for that duration.
