# Triggering Workflows

You can use the `hatchet trigger` command to trigger workflows locally for testing and development purposes. This command allows you to set up triggers in your `hatchet.yaml` file that define how to run specific workflows.

## Example

In your `hatchet.yaml` file, you can define a trigger for a simple workflow like this:

```yaml
triggers:
  - name: "simple"
    command: "poetry run python src/run.py"
    description: "Trigger a simple workflow"
```

Then, you can select this trigger when running the `hatchet trigger` command:

```sh
hatchet trigger simple
```

Or just `hatchet trigger`, which will prompt you to select a trigger interactively.
