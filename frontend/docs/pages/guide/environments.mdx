# Managing Environments with Hatchet

## Multiple Developers, One Orchestrator

When multiple developers share a single Hatchet orchestrator, conflicts can arise as workflow runs and events intermingle. Without proper isolation, one developer's workflows might interfere with another's testing or development work.

Hatchet provides three key solutions for managing this challenge: namespaces, multi-tenancy, and a local Hatchet instance.

### Solution 1: Multi-Tenancy

The easiest way to isolate environments for different developers or teams is to use Hatchet's multi-tenancy feature. Each tenant represents a separate environment with its own set of workflows and workers. To add a new tenant for each developer, create an organization and follow these steps:

1. Access the organization dropdown in the dashboard (top right)
2. Select the `+` icon next to your organization's name
3. Generate a new token for that tenant
4. Each developer configures their environment with their designated tenant token

### Solution 2: Local Hatchet Instance

If you are using Hatchet locally, you can create a local instance of Hatchet to manage your isolated local development environment. Follow instructions [here](../self-hosting/hatchet-lite.mdx) to get started.
