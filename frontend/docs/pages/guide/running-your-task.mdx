# Running Your First Task

With your task defined, you can import it wherever you need to use it and invoke it with the `run` method.

<UniversalTabs items={["Python", "Typescript", "Go", "Ruby"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab title="Python">

<Snippet src={snippets.python.quickstart.run.run_a_task} />

<Tabs.Tab title="Typescript">
<Snippet src={snippets.typescript.simple.run.running_a_task} />

<Tabs.Tab title="Go">

## Where you can trigger from

You can trigger tasks in two main ways:

- **Same codebase or monorepo** — Import your task or workflow and call `run`, `run_no_wait`, or other trigger methods directly. Your API server, CLI, or another service in the same repo can use the same task definition to enqueue or run tasks.
- **External API or separate service (polyrepo)** — When the code that triggers the task cannot import the task definition (e.g. a different repo, language, or microservice), use a **stub**: a Hatchet task with the same name and input/output types but no implementation. The stub runs on the triggering service and enqueues work that your Hatchet workers execute. See [Inter-Service Triggering](/features/inter-service-triggering) for details.

## Ways of running tasks

Hatchet supports several trigger styles; pick the one that fits your use case. Full details are in [Features → Ways of Running Tasks](/features/running-tasks).

| Style | Use case | Doc |
|-------|----------|-----|
| **Run and wait** | Call a task and get the result (e.g. fanout, LLM calls) | [Run and Wait Trigger](/features/run-with-results) |
| **Fire and forget** | Enqueue without waiting (e.g. emails, long jobs) | [Run Without Wait Trigger](/features/run-no-wait) |
| **Scheduled** | Run once at a specific time in the future | [Scheduled Trigger](/features/scheduled-runs) |
| **Cron** | Run on a recurring schedule (daily, weekly, etc.) | [Cron Trigger](/features/cron-runs) |
| **Events** | Run when an event is emitted (e.g. webhooks, queues) | [Event Trigger](/features/run-on-event) |
| **Bulk** | Run the same task many times with different inputs | [Bulk Run Many](/features/bulk-run) |
| **Webhooks** | Let external systems trigger workflows via HTTP | [Webhooks](/features/webhooks) |

Next, explore [Run and Wait](/features/run-with-results) or [Fire and Forget](/features/run-no-wait) for the most common patterns, or [Inter-Service Triggering](/features/inter-service-triggering) to trigger from an external API using a stub.
