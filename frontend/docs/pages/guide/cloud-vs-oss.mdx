# Cloud vs OSS

Hatchet is available as **Hatchet Cloud** (managed) and as **open source** (self-hosted). The programming model is the same: you write tasks/workflows in code and run workers that connect to Hatchet.

This page helps you decide which deployment model fits your team.

## Quick decision guide

Choose **Hatchet Cloud** if you want:

- the Hatchet control plane operated for you (upgrades, scaling, backups)
- the fastest path to production
- a status page and managed incident response

Choose **self-hosted (OSS)** if you need:

- full control over infrastructure and networking
- strict data residency or air-gapped environments
- a deployment you can customize and operate with your own tooling

## What’s the same in both

- **SDK + worker model**: your workers run your code and connect to Hatchet
- **Durability + retries**: tasks are durably tracked and retry according to configuration
- **Observability surfaces**: you can inspect runs, workers, and workflow history
- **Core semantics**: the same workflows/tasks/concurrency patterns apply

## What changes (operational responsibilities)

### Hatchet Cloud (managed)

Hatchet runs and operates the Hatchet services. You bring:

- your worker processes
- your application code that triggers workflows
- your operational policies (timeouts, retries, concurrency, rate limits)

For security and compliance documentation, see the **[Hatchet Trust Center](https://trust.hatchet.run/)**. For current incidents and historical uptime, see **[status.hatchet.run](https://status.hatchet.run/)**.

### Self-hosted (OSS)

You run and operate the Hatchet services and their dependencies. Typical responsibilities include:

- provisioning and scaling the Hatchet services
- managing PostgreSQL (and any optional components you deploy)
- backups, upgrades, and monitoring
- network security and access control for the API/DB

If you’re planning production usage, start with:

- [Self Hosting](/self-hosting)
- [High Availability](/self-hosting/high-availability)
- [Security](/guide/security)

## Migrating between Cloud and self-hosted

You can move between deployment models without rewriting worker code. In practice, migration usually means:

- pointing workers and clients at a new endpoint
- swapping credentials/tokens
- validating environment-specific settings (TLS, networking, retention, etc.)
