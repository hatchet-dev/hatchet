# Triggering Workflows

You can use the `hatchet worker run` command to trigger workflows locally for testing and development purposes. This command allows you to set up scripts in your `hatchet.yaml` file that define how to run specific workflows.

## Example

In your `hatchet.yaml` file, you can define a script for a simple workflow like this:

```yaml
scripts:
  - name: "simple"
    command: "poetry run python src/run.py"
    description: "Trigger a simple workflow"
```

Then, you can select this script when running the `hatchet worker run` command:

```sh
hatchet worker run --script simple
```

Or just `hatchet worker run`, which will prompt you to select a script interactively.
