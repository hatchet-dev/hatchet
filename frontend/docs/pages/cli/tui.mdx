# Using the Hatchet TUI

The Hatchet CLI includes a built-in terminal user interface (TUI) that you can use to interact with your Hatchet deployment directly from the terminal. The TUI provides real-time observability into tasks, workflows, workers, and more:

```sh
hatchet tui
```

# Features

<Callout type="info">
  You can access help documentation by pressing the `h` key within the TUI. This
  will display a list of available commands and their descriptions.
