# Profiles

The Hatchet CLI supports managing multiple Hatchet instances and tenants using named profiles. This feature makes it easy to switch between different environments, such as development, staging, and production.

## Creating a Profile

You can create a new profile using the `hatchet profile add` command. You will need to provide a Hatchet API token for the profile.

```sh
hatchet profile add
```

This command will prompt you to enter the API token followed by the profile name. You can also provide these as flags:

```sh
hatchet profile add --name [name] --token [token]
```

## Listing Profiles

You can list all the profiles you have configured using the `hatchet profile list` command:

```sh
hatchet profile list
```

## Using a Profile

To use a specific profile for your Hatchet CLI commands, you can specify the profile name using the `--profile` flag. For example:

```sh
hatchet worker dev --profile [name]
```

## Updating a Profile

You can update an existing profile using the `hatchet profile update` command. This allows you to change the API token associated with a profile.

```sh
hatchet profile update
```

## Deleting a Profile

You can delete a profile using the `hatchet profile delete` command:

```sh
hatchet profile delete
```
