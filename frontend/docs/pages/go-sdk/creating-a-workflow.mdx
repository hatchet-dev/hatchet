# Creating a Workflow

The simplest way to define a workflow is by using the `worker.On` method. This method accepts two arguments: a workflow trigger and the workflow definition. For example, to trigger a workflow on the `user:created` event, you can do the following:

```go
w.On(
    worker.Event("user:created"), 
    &worker.WorkflowJob{
        Name:        "post-user-sign-up",
        Description: "Workflow that executes after a user signs up.",
        Timeout:     "60s",
        Steps: []worker.WorkflowStep{
            worker.Fn(func(ctx context.Context) error {
                return nil
            }),
        },
    },
)
```

**Supported Workflow Triggers**

- `worker.Event` - triggers a workflow when an event is received
- `worker.Events` - triggers a workflow when any of the given events are received
- `worker.Cron` - triggers a workflow on a cron schedule
- `worker.Crons` - triggers a workflow from multiple cron schedules
- `worker.At` - triggers a workflow at a specific time. This is useful for one-off workflows. You can also schedule workflows using the `Admin` API - see [here](./scheduling-workflows) for more information.

**Supported Workflow Definitions**

- `*worker.WorkflowJob` - a workflow that executes a series of steps
- `worker.Fn` - a single-step workflow ([see below](#single-step-workflows))

## Single-Step Workflows

If your workflow is a single method, you can use `worker.Fn` to define your workflow:

```go
w.On(
    worker.Event("user:created"), 
    worker.Fn(func(ctx context.Context) error {
        return nil
    }),
)
```

Anonymous functions will be given an auto-generated name based on the package and parent function name. To avoid ugly auto-generated names, you can use `SetName` on the `worker.Fn` struct:

```go
w.On(
    worker.Event("user:created"), 
    worker.Fn(func(ctx context.Context) error {
        return nil
    }).SetName("post-user-create"), // this workflow will be named "post-user-create"
)
```

## Passing Arguments to Steps

Step functions must always accept a `context.Context` as the first argument, and must return an `error` as the last return value. They can optionally accept a second argument or return a value -- both of these must be a pointer to a struct. The following are valid step functions:

```go
func (ctx context.Context) error 
func (ctx context.Context, in *myInput) error
func (ctx context.Context, in *myInput) (*myOutput, error)
func (ctx context.Context) (*myOutput, error)
```

> Why pointers to structs? We use JSON marshalling/unmarshalling under the hood, and pointers to structs are the most predictable way to marshal and unmarshal values. You can use `json` tags and `MarshalJSON` + `UnmarshalJSON` methods to customize the marshalling/unmarshalling behavior.

Additionally, if the second argument of the first step function is a pointer to a struct, the event payload will be unmarshalled into that struct. For example, given the following event:

```go
type MyEvent struct {
    Name string `json:"name"`
}
```

You can declare the following step function:

```go
func FirstStep(ctx context.Context, event *MyEvent) error {
    fmt.Println("got event: ", event.Name)
    return nil
}
```

If the second argument of a step function matches the type of the first return value of the previous step function, the return value of the previous step function will be passed to the next step function. For example, the `firstStepOutput` struct will be passed between step functions:

```go
type firstStepOutput struct {
    Output string `json:"output"`
}

func FirstStep(ctx context.Context) (*firstStepOutput, error) {
    return &firstStepOutput{Output: "foo"}, nil
}

func SecondStep(ctx context.Context, in *firstStepOutput) error {
    fmt.Println("got first step output: ", in.Output)
    return nil
}
```

## Services

Services are a way to logically group workflows into different categories. For example, you may have a `user` service that contains all workflows related to users. You can define a service by using the `worker.NewService` method. For example, to define a `user` service, you can do the following:

```go
userService := w.NewService("user")

userService.On(
    worker.Event("user:created"), 
    &worker.WorkflowJob{
        Name:        "post-user-sign-up",
        Description: "Workflow that executes after a user signs up.",
        Timeout:     "60s",
        Steps: []worker.WorkflowStep{
            {
                Function: func(ctx context.Context) error {
                    fmt.Println("running post-user sign up")
                    return nil
                },
            },
        },
    },
)
```

While this is mostly a convenience method at the moment, we plan to add more features to services in the future, like service-level metrics and service-level retries.

## Cron Schedules

You can declare a cron schedule by passing `worker.Cron` to the `worker.On` method. For example, to trigger a workflow every 5 minutes, you can do the following:

```go
w.On(
    worker.Cron("*/5 * * * *"), 
    &worker.WorkflowJob{
        Name:        "my-cron-job",
        Description: "Cron workflow example.",
        Timeout:     "60s",
        Steps: []worker.WorkflowStep{
            {
                Function: func(ctx context.Context) error {
                    fmt.Println("triggered at:", time.Now())
                    return nil
                },
            },
        },
    },
)
```

## Middleware

You can define middleware that will be executed before and after each step function. Middleware functions have the following signature:

```go
func(ctx context.Context, next func(context.Context) error) error
```

You can register this middleware globally (at the worker level) or at the service level, using `worker.Use` and `service.Use`, respectively. For example, to define a middleware that logs the start and end of each step function, you can do the following:

```go
w.Use(func(ctx context.Context, next func(context.Context) error) error {
    // time the function duration
    start := time.Now()
    err := next(ctx)
    duration := time.Since(start)
    fmt.Printf("step function took %s\n", duration)
    return err
})
```

You can also use the middleware to add values to the context. For example:

```go
w.Use(func(ctx context.Context, next func(context.Context) error) error {
    err := next(context.WithValue(ctx, "testkey", "testvalue"))

    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("error in middleware: %w", err)
    }

    return nil
})
```
