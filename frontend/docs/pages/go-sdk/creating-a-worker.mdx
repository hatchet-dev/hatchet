# Creating a Worker

Workers can be created via the `worker.NewWorker` method, which requires the `worker.WithClient` arg to work:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/hatchet-dev/hatchet/pkg/client"
	"github.com/hatchet-dev/hatchet/pkg/worker"
)

func main() {
    c, err := client.New(
        // this is the GRPC host and port of the Hatchet instance
		client.WithHostPort("127.0.0.1", 7077),
	)

	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

    w, err := worker.NewWorker(
        worker.WithClient(c),
    )

    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // ... workflow code

    // start the worker
    w.Start(context.Background())
}
```

## Termination Signals

The worker will terminate when the context passed to `Start` is cancelled. Hatchet provides the `cmdutils.NewInterruptContext` method to create a context that will be cancelled when the process receives an interrupt signal (e.g. `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM`). This can be used via:

```go
ctx, cancel := cmdutils.NewInterruptContext()

defer cancel()

w.Start(ctx)
```

## All Worker Options

### `worker.WithClient`

The client to use to communicate with the Hatchet instance. This is required.

### `worker.WithName`

The name of the worker. This is used to identify the worker in the Hatchet UI.
