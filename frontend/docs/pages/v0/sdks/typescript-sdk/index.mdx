# Typescript SDK

This is the Hatchet Typescript SDK reference. On this page, we'll get you up and running with a Typescript worker. This guide assumes that you already have a Hatchet engine instance running. If you don't, you can:

- Sign up on [Hatchet Cloud](https://cloud.onhatchet.run)
- [Self-host Hatchet](https://docs.hatchet.run/self-hosting)

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸª“">
  If you run into any issues, please file an issue on the [Hatchet Typescript
  SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/hatchet-dev/hatchet-typescript).
</Callout>

## Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @hatchet-dev/typescript-sdk
```

## Generate a Token

Navigate to your Hatchet dashboard and navigate to your settings tab. You should see a section called "API Keys". Click "Create API Key", input a name for the key and copy the key. Then set the following environment variables:

```sh
HATCHET_CLIENT_TOKEN="<your-api-key>"
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸª“">
You may need to set additional environment variables depending on your self-hosted configuration. The Hatchet clients default to SSL by default, but to disable this you can set:

```
HATCHET_CLIENT_TLS_STRATEGY=none
```

</Callout>

## Run your first worker

Make sure you've set the `HATCHET_CLIENT_TOKEN` environment variable via `export HATCHET_CLIENT_TOKEN="<your-api-key>"`. Next, copy the following code into a `worker.ts` file:

```typescript filename="worker.ts" copy
import Hatchet, { Workflow } from "@hatchet-dev/typescript-sdk";

const hatchet = Hatchet.init();

const workflow: Workflow = {
  id: "first-typescript-workflow",
  description: "This is my first workflow",
  on: {
    event: "user:create",
  },
  steps: [
    {
      name: "step1",
      run: async (ctx) => {
        console.log(
          "starting step1 with the following input",
          ctx.workflowInput(),
        );

        return {
          result: "success!",
        };
      },
    },
  ],
};

const worker = hatchet.worker("my-worker");
await worker.registerWorkflow(workflow);
worker.start();
```

Next, modify your `package.json` to include a script to start:

```json
{
  // ...rest of your `package.json`
  "scripts": {
    // ...existing scripts
    "worker": "npx ts-node worker.ts"
  }
}
```

Now to start the worker, in a new terminal run:

```sh npm2yarn
npm run worker
```

## Run your first workflow

The worker is now running and listening for steps to execute. You should see your first worker registered in the `Workers` tab of the Hatchet dashboard:

You can now trigger your first workflow by navigating to the `Workflows` tab, selecting your workflow, and clicking the top right "Trigger workflow" button:

![Quickstart 2](/quickstart-2.png)

That's it! You've successfully deployed Hatchet and run your first workflow.

## Next Steps

Congratulations on running your first workflow!
