# Using the Hatchet Dashboard

The Hatchet Dashboard is a powerful web-based interface that allows you to monitor, manage, and troubleshoot your workflows. It provides a centralized view of your workflows, their execution history, and performance metrics, enabling you to gain insights into the behavior and health of your system.

## Accessing the Dashboard

To access the Hatchet Dashboard, you need to have a Hatchet account and be logged in. Once logged in, you can navigate to the dashboard by clicking on the "Dashboard" link in the top navigation menu or by directly accessing the dashboard URL provided by your Hatchet instance.

## Dashboard Overview

The Hatchet Dashboard consists of several key sections and features:

1. **Workflow List**: The main page of the dashboard displays a list of all your workflows. Each workflow is represented by a card that shows its name, description, and key metrics such as the number of total runs, successful runs, and failed runs.

2. **Workflow Details**: Clicking on a workflow card takes you to the workflow details page. This page provides a comprehensive view of the selected workflow, including its definition, execution history, and performance metrics.

3. **Execution History**: The execution history section shows a list of all the runs of the selected workflow. Each run is listed with its status (success, failure, or in-progress), start time, duration, and input data. You can click on a specific run to view its details, including the input data, output data, and any logs or error messages.

4. **Logs and Debugging**: The dashboard provides access to the logs generated by your workflows and their individual steps. You can view the logs for a specific run or step to help diagnose issues and debug problems. The logs are searchable and filterable, making it easier to find relevant information.

5. **Worker Management**: The dashboard allows you to manage your workers directly from the interface. You can inspect or delete workflows that are no longer needed.

## Monitoring Workflows

One of the primary uses of the Hatchet Dashboard is to monitor the health and performance of your workflows. By regularly checking the dashboard, you can:

- Track the overall execution status of your workflows, identifying any failures or errors that need attention.
- Monitor the throughput and latency of your workflows, ensuring they are meeting performance expectations.
- Identify any bottlenecks or slowdowns in your workflows by analyzing the duration and resource usage of individual steps.
- Detect anomalies or unusual behavior by comparing the metrics and charts across different time periods or workflow versions.

## Troubleshooting and Debugging

When issues arise in your workflows, the Hatchet Dashboard is an invaluable tool for troubleshooting and debugging. You can:

- Inspect the execution history of a failed run to understand the sequence of events leading to the failure.
- View the input and output data of a specific run to identify any anomalies or unexpected values.
- Analyze the logs and error messages associated with a failed step to pinpoint the root cause of the issue.
- Use the search and filtering capabilities to find relevant log entries or error patterns across multiple runs.

## Best Practices for Using the Dashboard

To make the most of the Hatchet Dashboard, consider the following best practices:

1. **Regularly monitor your workflows**: Make it a habit to check the dashboard regularly to stay informed about the health and performance of your workflows. Set up alerts or notifications to get proactively notified of any issues or anomalies.

2. **Investigate failures promptly**: When you notice a failed run or an error in the dashboard, investigate it promptly to minimize the impact on your system. Use the debugging and troubleshooting features to identify and resolve the issue quickly.

3. **Analyze metrics and trends**: Use the metrics and charts provided by the dashboard to gain insights into the behavior and performance of your workflows over time. Look for trends, patterns, or anomalies that may indicate potential problems or opportunities for optimization.

4. **Collaborate with your team**: Share access to the dashboard with your team members and collaborate on monitoring, troubleshooting, and optimizing your workflows. Use the dashboard as a centralized platform for communication and knowledge sharing.

5. **Customize and extend**: Take advantage of any customization or extension capabilities provided by the Hatchet Dashboard. This may include creating custom metrics, dashboards, or integrations with other tools in your ecosystem.

By leveraging the features and best practices of the Hatchet Dashboard, you can effectively monitor, manage, and troubleshoot your workflows, ensuring their reliability, performance, and smooth operation.

Remember, the dashboard is a powerful tool, but it's not a substitute for good design and implementation practices. Use the insights gained from the dashboard to continuously improve your workflows, optimize their performance, and enhance their resilience.
