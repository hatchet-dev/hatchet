# Workflows in Hatchet

Now that you understand the foundational [Step](./steps) concept, you can combine these foundational building blocks into a structured sequence of tasks, known as a **workflow**.

Workflows can be as simple as a single step or as complex as a multi-step process with branching logic and parallel execution. Hatchet offers a declarative-first approach, providing a clear, organized blueprint for task execution.

## Declarative Workflow Design (DAGs)

Hatchet workflows are designed in a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** format, where each step is a node in the graph, and the dependencies between steps are the edges. This structure ensures that workflows are organized, predictable, and free from circular dependencies. By defining the sequence and dependencies of steps upfront, you can easily understand the actual runtime state as compared to the expected state when debugging or troubleshooting.

### Example: A Simple DAG Workflow

Here's an example of a simple graphical DAG workflow in Hatchet, consisting of four steps:

![Simple DAG](/simple-dag.png)

Each Step is represented as a node in the graph, and the arrows between the nodes represent the dependencies between the steps (left to right). In this example, `start` must complete before `load_docs` can start, `load_docs` must complete before `reason_docs` can start, and so on.

These relationships are defined in code by specifying required parents in the `parent` array of that step.

```python
@hatchet.workflow(on_events=["question:create"])
class BasicRagWorkflow:
    @hatchet.step()
    def start(self, context: Context):
        return {
            "status": "starting...",
        }
    @hatchet.step()
    def load_docs(self, context: Context):
        # Load the relevant documents
        return {
            "status": "docs loaded",
            "docs": text_content,
        }

    @hatchet.step(parents=["load_docs"])
    def reason_docs(self, ctx: Context):
        docs = ctx.step_output("load_docs")['docs']
        # Reason about the relevant docs

        return {
            "status": "writing a response",
            "research": research,
        }

    @hatchet.step(parents=["reason_docs"])
    def generate_response(self, ctx: Context):
        docs = ctx.step_output("reason_docs")['research']
        # Reason about the relevant docs

        return {
            "status": "complete",
            "message": message,
        }

```

const workflow: Workflow = {
  id: 'basic-rag-workflow',
  on: {
    event: 'question:create',
  },
  steps: [
    {
      name: 'start',
      run: async (ctx) => {
        return {

    {
      name: 'generate_response',
      parents: ['reason_docs'],
      run: (ctx) => {
        const research = ctx.stepOutput("reason_docs")['research']
        // Generate a message
        return {
            "status": "complete",
            "message": message,
        }
      },
    },

  ],
};
```

### Accessing Workflow State Within a Step

In Hatchet, each step within a workflow has access to parent step outputs. This capability allows you to pass data between steps, enabling you to build complex workflows that respond dynamically to the outcomes of previous steps.

<UniversalTabs items={['Python', 'Typescript']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```python
@hatchet.step(parents=["previous_step"])
def my_step(context: Context) -> dict:
    data = context.workflow_input()
    previous_step_data = ctx.step_output("previous_step")
    # Perform some operation
    return output
    ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
```typescript
const workflow: Workflow = {
  // ... rest of workflow definition
  steps: [
    // ... other steps
    {
      name: 'my_step',
      parents=["previous_step"]
      run: async (ctx) => {
        const data = ctx.workflowInput();
        const previousStepData = ctx.stepOutput("previous_step");
        // Perform some operation
        return output
      },
    },
    // ... other steps
  ]
};
```
    </Tabs.Tab>

{/* ## Spawning Child Workflows */}

{/* In Hatchet, while the core of workflow design is declarative, emphasizing upfront definition and organization, the platform provides the flexibility to integrate procedural logic where needed. This approach allows you to respond dynamically to the context within individual steps. This is helpful for: */}

{/* - **Branching Logic:** Utilize child workflows to navigate complex decision trees or conditional pathways, allowing your main workflow to adapt and respond to diverse outcomes or scenarios. */}
{/* - **Task Fan-Out:** Leverage the ability to fan out work by initiating multiple child workflows simultaneously, ideal for parallel processing or when a single step's output necessitates a broad, distributed series of subsequent actions. */}

## Next Steps: Understanding Workers

With a solid grasp of Hatchet's workflow capabilities, the next concept to explore is workers. Understanding workers is the last step to deploying and managing workflows with Hatchet.
