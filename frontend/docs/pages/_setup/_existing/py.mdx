#### Cd into your project directory

```bash copy
cd path-to-your-project
```

#### Install the Hatchet SDK and required dependencies

<InstallCommand withDevDependencies />


#### Create project directories

By convention it is recommended to create your workflows in the `workflows` directory and your workers in the `workers` directory.

```bash copy
mkdir workflows &&
mkdir workers
```

#### Instantiate your Hatchet Client

It is recommended to instantiate a shared Hatchet Client in a separate file as a singleton.

Create a new file called `hatchet-client.py` in your project root.

```bash copy
touch hatchet-client.py
```

Add the following code to the file:

```python copy
from hatchet_sdk import Hatchet

hatchet = Hatchet()
```

You can now import the Hatchet Client in any file that needs it.

```python copy
from src.hatchet_client import hatchet
```
