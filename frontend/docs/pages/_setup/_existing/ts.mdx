#### Cd into your project directory

```bash copy
cd path-to-your-project
```

#### Install the Hatchet SDK and required dependencies

<InstallCommand withDevDependencies />

#### Create project directories

By convention it is recommended to create your workflows in the `workflows` directory and your workers in the `workers` directory.

```bash copy
mkdir workflows &&
mkdir workers
```

#### Instantiate your Hatchet Client

It is recommended to instantiate a shared Hatchet Client in a separate file as a singleton.

Create a new file called `hatchet-client.ts` in your project root.

```bash copy
touch hatchet-client.ts
```

Add the following code to the file:

<Snippet src={snippets.typescript.hatchet_client.create_client} />
