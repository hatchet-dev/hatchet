#### Cd into your project directory

```bash copy
cd path-to-your-project
```

## Create project directories

By convention it is recommended to create your workflows in the `workflows` directory and your workers in the `workers` directory.

```bash copy
mkdir workflows &&
mkdir workers
```

## Instantiate your Hatchet Client

It is recommended to instantiate a shared Hatchet Client Factory in a separate file.

Create a new directory called `hatchet_client` and a new file called `main.go` in it.

```bash copy
mkdir hatchet_client &&
touch hatchet_client/main.go
```

Add the following code to the file:

```go copy
package hatchet

import (
	"github.com/hatchet-dev/hatchet/pkg/client"
)

func Client() (client.Client, error) {
	return client.New()
}
```

#### Install the Hatchet SDK and required dependencies

```bash copy
go mod tidy
```

#### Import the Hatchet Client Factory

You can now import the Hatchet Client Factory in any file that needs it.

```go copy
package main

import (
	"log"

	hatchet "hatchet-tutorial/src/hatchet_client"
)

func main() {
	hatchet, err := hatchet.Client()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```
