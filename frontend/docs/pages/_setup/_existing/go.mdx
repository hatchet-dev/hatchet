#### Cd into your project directory

```bash copy
cd /path/to/your-project
```

#### Create project directories

By convention it is recommended to create your workflows in the `workflows` directory and your workers in the `workers` directory.

```bash copy
mkdir workflows && mkdir workers
```

#### Install the Hatchet SDK and required dependencies

<InstallCommand installOnly />

#### Instantiate your Hatchet Client

You can now import the Hatchet Client Factory in any file that needs it.

In the `workers` directory, create a Hatchet client

```go copy
package main

import (
	"log"

	hatchet "github.com/hatchet-dev/hatchet/sdks/go"
)

func main() {
	client, err := hatchet.NewClient()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("failed to create hatchet client: %v", err)
	}
}
```
