#### Create a new project directory and cd into it

```bash copy
mkdir hatchet-tutorial && cd hatchet-tutorial
```

#### Initialize a new python project with required dependencies

<InstallCommand withDevDependencies />

mkdir src/workflows &&
mkdir src/workers
```

#### Instantiate your Hatchet Client

It is recommended to instantiate a shared Hatchet Client in a separate file as a singleton.

Create a new file called `hatchet_client.py`

```bash copy
touch src/hatchet_client.py
```

Add the following code to the file:

<Snippet src={snippets.python.setup.client.create_a_hatchet_client} />

You can now import the Hatchet Client in any file that needs it.

```python copy
from src.hatchet_client import hatchet
```
