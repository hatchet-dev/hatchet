#### Create a new project directory and cd into it

#### Instantiate your Hatchet Client

It is recommended to instantiate a shared Hatchet Client in a separate file as a singleton.

Create a new file called `hatchet_client.py`

```bash copy
touch src/hatchet_client.py
```

Add the following code to the file:

```python copy
from hatchet_sdk import Hatchet

hatchet = Hatchet()
```

You can now import the Hatchet Client in any file that needs it.

```python copy
from src.hatchet_client import hatchet
```
