#### Create a new project directory and cd into it

#### Instantiate your Hatchet Client

It is recommended to instantiate a shared Hatchet Client in a separate file as a singleton.

Create a new file called `hatchet-client.ts`

```bash copy
touch src/hatchet-client.ts
```

Add the following code to the file:

<Snippet src={snippets.typescript.hatchet_client.create_client} />

You can now import the Hatchet Client in any file that needs it.
