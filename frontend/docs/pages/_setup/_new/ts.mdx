#### Create a new project directory and cd into it

<InstallCommand withDevDependencies />

#### Instantiate your Hatchet Client

It is recommended to instantiate a shared Hatchet Client in a separate file as a singleton.

Create a new file called `hatchet-client.ts`

```bash copy
touch src/hatchet-client.ts
```

Add the following code to the file:

```typescript copy
import { Hatchet } from "@hatchet-dev/typescript-sdk";

export const hatchet = Hatchet.init();
```

You can now import the Hatchet Client in any file that needs it.

```typescript copy
import { hatchet } from "./hatchet-client";
```
