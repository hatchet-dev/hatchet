# SDKs

This document tracks the feature support of the various SDKs, and aims to consolidate the expected behavior around environment variables and configuration loading. 

## Environment Variables

Each SDK should support the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Required | Default |
| -------- | ----------- | -------- | ------- |
| `HATCHET_CLIENT_TOKEN` | The tenant-scoped API token to use. | Yes | N/A |
| `HATCHET_CLIENT_HOST_PORT` | The host and port of the Hatchet server to connect to, in `host:port` format. SDKs should handle schemes and trailing slashes, i.e. `https://host:port | Yes | N/A |
| `HATCHET_CLIENT_TLS_STRATEGY` | The TLS strategy to use. Valid values are `none`, `tls`, and `mtls`. | No | `tls` |
| `HATCHET_CLIENT_TLS_CERT_FILE` | The path to the TLS client certificate file to use. | Only if strategy is set to `mtls` | N/A |
| `HATCHET_CLIENT_TLS_CERT` | The TLS client key file to use. | Only if strategy is set to `mtls` | N/A |
| `HATCHET_CLIENT_TLS_KEY_FILE` | The path to the TLS client key file to use. | Only if strategy is set to `mtls` | N/A |
| `HATCHET_CLIENT_TLS_KEY` | The TLS client key to use. | Only if strategy is set to `mtls` | N/A |
| `HATCHET_CLIENT_TLS_ROOT_CA_FILE` | The path to the TLS root CA file to use. | Only if the server certificate is not signed by a public authority that's available to your environment | N/A |
| `HATCHET_CLIENT_TLS_ROOT_CA` | The TLS root CA to use. | Only if the server certificate is not signed by a public authority that's available to your environment | N/A |
| `HATCHET_CLIENT_TLS_SERVER_NAME` | The TLS server name to use. | No | Defaults to the `host` of the `host:port` |

The following environment variables are deprecated:

| Variable | Description | Explanation |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `HATCHET_CLIENT_TENANT_ID` | The tenant ID to use. | This is now part of the token. |
