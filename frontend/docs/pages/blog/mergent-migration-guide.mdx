# Mergent Migration Guide

As Mergent sunsets its services, we're here to help you seamlessly transition your background jobs and task processing to Hatchet, a modern, scalable platform for task orchestration in TypeScript, Python, and Go.

## Why Choose Hatchet?

Hatchet offers a comprehensive solution for modern distributed task processing:

- **Powerful Task Orchestration**: Build complex workflows using DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) with intuitive code
- **Durable Execution**: Reliable task processing with automatic retries and state persistence
- **Advanced Flow Control**: Fine-grained control over concurrency, rate limits, and task priorities
- **Real-time Observability**: Built-in monitoring dashboard and OpenTelemetry integration
- **Flexible Deployment**: Run workers anywhere - from serverless to your own infrastructure
- **Developer-First Experience**: Local development tools and straightforward debugging

Hatchet is trusted by F500s and startups for orchestrating AI, background jobs, and more.

## Migration Steps

### 1. Setting Up Hatchet Client

First, install the Hatchet SDK to your project:

<InstallCommand withLanguagePicker />

#### Instantiate your Hatchet Client

<UniversalTabs items={["Typescript", "Python", "Go"]}>
<Tabs.Tab title="Typescript">

It is recommended to instantiate a shared Hatchet Client in a separate file as a singleton.

Create a new file called `hatchet-client.ts` in your project root.

```typescript copy
import { Hatchet } from "@hatchet-dev/typescript-sdk";

export const hatchet = Hatchet.init();
```

You can now import the Hatchet Client in any file that needs it.

```typescript copy
import { hatchet } from "./hatchet-client";
```

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab title="Python">

It is recommended to instantiate a shared Hatchet Client in a separate file as a factory function.

Create a new file called `hatchet-client.py` in your project root.

```python copy
from hatchet_sdk import Hatchet

hatchet = Hatchet()
```

You can now import the Hatchet Client in any file that needs it.

```python copy
from .hatchet_client import hatchet
```

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab title="Go">

It is recommended to instantiate a shared Hatchet Client in a separate file as a factory function.

Create a new file called `hatchet-client.go` in your project root.

```go
package migration_guides

import (
	v1 "github.com/hatchet-dev/hatchet/pkg/v1"
)

func HatchetClient() (v1.HatchetClient, error) {
	hatchet, err := v1.NewHatchetClient()

	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	return hatchet, nil
}
```

You can now import the Hatchet Client in any file that needs it.

```go
import (
	"github.com/your-project/migration_guides"
)

hatchet, err := migration_guides.HatchetClient()
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
```

</Tabs.Tab>
</UniversalTabs>

### 2. Converting Mergent Tasks

Let's look at an example of converting a Mergent task to Hatchet. We'll use an image processing task as an example:

<UniversalTabs items={["Typescript", "Python", "Go"]}>
<Tabs.Tab title="Typescript">
#### Before (Mergent)
<GithubSnippet src={Ts}  target="Before (Mergent)" />

After (Hatchet)

<GithubSnippet src={Ts} target="After (Hatchet)" />

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab title="Python">
#### Before (Mergent)
<GithubSnippet src={Py}  target="Before (Mergent)" />

#### After (Hatchet)

<GithubSnippet src={Py} target="After (Hatchet)" />

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab title="Go">
#### Before (Mergent)
<GithubSnippet src={Go}  target="Before (Mergent)" />

#### After (Hatchet)

<GithubSnippet src={Go} target="After (Hatchet)" />

</Tabs.Tab>
</UniversalTabs>

Key differences in the Hatchet implementation:

- **Type Safety**: Hatchet provides built-in type validation using Pydantic/TypeScript/Go types
- **Step-based Execution**: Tasks are broken down into atomic steps for better observability and retry control
- **Rich Metadata**: Enhanced return types with additional metadata
- **Built-in Retries**: Configurable retry policies at the task level
- **Timeout Control**: Explicit timeout settings to prevent hung tasks

### 3. Migrating Task Triggers

In Mergent the

<UniversalTabs items={["Typescript", "Python", "Go"]}>
<Tabs.Tab title="Typescript">
#### Before (Mergent)
The primary way of triggering tasks in Mergent is via the API.

<GithubSnippet src={Ts} target="Running a task (Mergent)" />

#### After (Hatchet)

The primary way of triggering tasks in Hatchet is via the SDK.

<GithubSnippet src={Ts} target="Running a task (Hatchet)" />

This offers a fully typed way to trigger tasks, with validation of the input parameters.

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab title="Python">
#### Before (Mergent)
The primary way of triggering tasks in Mergent is via the API.
<GithubSnippet src={Py}  target="Running a task (Mergent)" />

#### After (Hatchet)

The primary way of triggering tasks in Hatchet is via the SDK.

<GithubSnippet src={Py} target="Running a task (Hatchet)" />

This offers a fully typed way to trigger tasks, with validation of the input parameters.

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab title="Go">
#### Before (Mergent)
<GithubSnippet src={Go}  target="Running a task (Mergent)" />

#### After (Hatchet)

The primary way of triggering tasks in Hatchet is via the SDK.

<GithubSnippet src={Go} target="Running a task (Hatchet)" />

This offers a fully typed way to trigger tasks, with validation of the input parameters.

</Tabs.Tab>
</UniversalTabs>

### 4. Converting Scheduled Tasks

In Mergent you could schedule tasks to run at a specific time using a cron expression or a fixed time via the dashboard or by adding a delay to the request body.

You can do the same in the Hatchet dashboard or programmatically using the SDK:

<UniversalTabs items={["Typescript", "Python", "Go"]}>
<Tabs.Tab title="Typescript">
#### Before (Mergent)
<GithubSnippet src={Ts}  target="Scheduling tasks (Mergent)" />

#### After (Hatchet)

<GithubSnippet src={Ts}  target="Scheduling tasks (Hatchet)" />
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab title="Python">
#### Before (Mergent)
<GithubSnippet src={Py}  target="Scheduling tasks (Mergent)" />

#### After (Hatchet)

<GithubSnippet src={Py}  target="Scheduling tasks (Hatchet)" />
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab title="Go">

#### After (Hatchet)

<GithubSnippet src={Go}  target="Scheduling tasks (Hatchet)" />
</Tabs.Tab>
</UniversalTabs>

## Worker Differences

In Mergent tasks are processed by an HTTP endpoint. In Hatchet there are two ways to process tasks:

1. **Long-Running Worker** (recommended): Process tasks via a long-running worker
   a. [Managed by Hatchet](../home/compute) -- fully integrated with the platform and automatically scales with your workload
   b. [Self-hosted](../home/workers) -- use your own infrastructure to run the worker
2. **HTTP Endpoint**: Process tasks via an HTTP endpoint via [webhook support (V0 only, v1 coming soon)](https://v0-docs.hatchet.run/home/features/webhooks)
