# Mergent Migration Guide

As Mergent sunsets its services, we're here to help you seamlessly transition your background jobs and task processing to Hatchet, a modern, scalable platform for task orchestration in TypeScript, Python, and Go.

## Why Choose Hatchet?

Hatchet offers a comprehensive solution for modern distributed task processing:

- **Powerful Task Orchestration**: Build complex workflows using DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) with intuitive code
- **Durable Execution**: Reliable task processing with automatic retries and state persistence
- **Advanced Flow Control**: Fine-grained control over concurrency, rate limits, and task priorities
- **Real-time Observability**: Built-in monitoring dashboard and OpenTelemetry integration
- **Flexible Deployment**: Run workers anywhere - from serverless to your own infrastructure
- **Developer-First Experience**: Local development tools and straightforward debugging

Hatchet is trusted by F500s and startups for orchestrating AI, background jobs, and more.

## Migration Steps

### 1. Setting Up Hatchet Client

First, install the Hatchet SDK to your project:

<InstallCommand withLanguagePicker />

#### Instantiate your Hatchet Client

<UniversalTabs items={["Typescript", "Python", "Go"]}>
<Tabs.Tab title="Typescript">

It is recommended to instantiate a shared Hatchet Client in a separate file as a singleton.

Create a new file called `hatchet-client.ts` in your project root.

<Snippet src={snips.typescript.hatchet_client} block="ALL" />

You can now import the Hatchet Client in any file that needs it.

```typescript copy
import { hatchet } from "./hatchet-client";
```

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab title="Python">

It is recommended to instantiate a shared Hatchet Client in a separate file as a factory function.

Create a new file called `hatchet-client.py` in your project root.

```python copy
from hatchet_sdk import Hatchet

hatchet = Hatchet()
```

You can now import the Hatchet Client in any file that needs it.

```python copy
from .hatchet_client import hatchet
```

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab title="Go">

It is recommended to instantiate a shared Hatchet Client in a separate file as a factory function.

Create a new file called `hatchet-client.go` in your project root.

```go
package migration_guides

import (
	v1 "github.com/hatchet-dev/hatchet/pkg/v1"
)

func HatchetClient() (v1.HatchetClient, error) {
	hatchet, err := v1.NewHatchetClient()

	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	return hatchet, nil
}
```

You can now import the Hatchet Client in any file that needs it.

```go
import (
	"github.com/your-project/migration_guides"
)

hatchet, err := migration_guides.HatchetClient()
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
```

</Tabs.Tab>
</UniversalTabs>

### 2. Converting Mergent Tasks

Let's look at an example of converting a Mergent task to Hatchet. We'll use an image processing task as an example:

<UniversalTabs items={["Typescript", "Python", "Go"]}>
<Tabs.Tab title="Typescript">
#### Before (Mergent)
<Snippet src={snips.typescript.migration_guides.mergent} block="before_mergent" />

#### After (Hatchet)

<Snippet
  src={snips.typescript.migration_guides.mergent}
  block="after_hatchet"
/>

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab title="Python">
#### Before (Mergent)
<Snippet src={snips.python.migration_guides.mergent} block="before_mergent" />

#### After (Hatchet)

<Snippet src={snips.python.migration_guides.mergent} block="after_hatchet" />

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab title="Go">
#### Before (Mergent)
<Snippet src={snips.go.migration_guides.mergent} block="before_mergent" />

#### After (Hatchet)

<Snippet src={snips.go.migration_guides.mergent} block="after_hatchet" />

</Tabs.Tab>
</UniversalTabs>

Key differences in the Hatchet implementation:

- **Type Safety**: Hatchet provides built-in type validation using Pydantic/TypeScript/Go types
- **Step-based Execution**: Tasks are broken down into atomic steps for better observability and retry control
- **Rich Metadata**: Enhanced return types with additional metadata
- **Built-in Retries**: Configurable retry policies at the task level
- **Timeout Control**: Explicit timeout settings to prevent hung tasks

### 3. Migrating Task Triggers

In Mergent the primary way of triggering tasks was via the REST API or in the dashboard.

In Hatchet the primary way of triggering tasks is via the SDK. This offers a fully typed way to trigger tasks, with fully typed outputs of the task.

<UniversalTabs items={["Typescript", "Python", "Go"]}>
<Tabs.Tab title="Typescript">
#### Before (Mergent)

<Snippet
  src={snips.typescript.migration_guides.mergent}
  block="running_a_task_mergent"
/>

#### After (Hatchet)

<Snippet
  src={snips.typescript.migration_guides.mergent}
  block="running_a_task_hatchet"
/>

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab title="Python">
#### Before (Mergent)
<Snippet src={snips.python.migration_guides.mergent} block="running_a_task_mergent" />

The primary way of triggering tasks in Hatchet is via the SDK.

<Snippet
  src={snips.python.migration_guides.mergent}
  block="running_a_task_hatchet"
/>

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab title="Go">
#### Before (Mergent)
<Snippet src={snips.go.migration_guides.mergent} block="running_a_task_mergent" />

#### After (Hatchet)

<Snippet
  src={snips.go.migration_guides.mergent}
  block="running_a_task_hatchet"
/>

</Tabs.Tab>
</UniversalTabs>

### 4. Converting Scheduled Tasks

In Mergent you could schedule tasks to run at a specific time using a cron expression or a fixed time via the dashboard or by adding a delay to the request body.

You can do the same in the Hatchet dashboard or programmatically using the SDK:

<UniversalTabs items={["Typescript", "Python", "Go"]}>
<Tabs.Tab title="Typescript">
#### Before (Mergent)
<Snippet src={snips.typescript.migration_guides.mergent} block="scheduling_tasks_mergent" />

#### After (Hatchet)

<Snippet src={snips.typescript.migration_guides.mergent} block="scheduling_tasks_hatchet" />
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab title="Python">
#### Before (Mergent)
<Snippet src={snips.python.migration_guides.mergent} block="scheduling_tasks_mergent" />

#### After (Hatchet)

<Snippet src={snips.python.migration_guides.mergent} block="scheduling_tasks_hatchet" />
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab title="Go">

#### After (Hatchet)

<Snippet src={snips.go.migration_guides.mergent} block="scheduling_tasks_hatchet" />
</Tabs.Tab>
</UniversalTabs>

## Worker Differences

In Mergent tasks are processed by an HTTP endpoint. In Hatchet there are two ways to process tasks:

1. **Long-Running Worker** (recommended): Process tasks via a long-running worker
   a. [Managed by Hatchet](../home/compute) -- fully integrated with the platform and automatically scales with your workload
   b. [Self-hosted](../home/workers) -- use your own infrastructure to run the worker
2. **HTTP Endpoint**: Process tasks via an HTTP endpoint via [webhook support (V0 only, V1 coming soon)](https://v0-docs.hatchet.run/home/features/webhooks)
