Like seemingly everyone else on the planet, we've been spending the last few months fussing over agents.

In particular, we've been seeing the adoption of agents drive the growth of our orchestration platform, so we have some insight into what sorts of stacks and frameworks — [or lack thereof](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents) — work well here.

One of the more interesting things we've seen is a proliferation of hybrid stacks: a typical Next.js or FastAPI backend, coupled with an _agent written in Go,_ even at a very early stage.

As a long-time Go developer, this is rather exciting; here's why I think this will be a more common approach moving forward.

## What's an agent?

Terminology here is muddled, but in general I'm referring to a process which is executing in a loop, where the process has some agency over the next step in its execution path. How much agency? More than none. We'd call a fully deterministic path [a workflow](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents) (which can be a component of an agent).

Agents typically have a number of shared characteristics when they start to scale (read: _have actual users_):

1. They are long-running — anywhere from seconds to minutes to hours.
2. Each execution is expensive — not just the LLM calls, but the nature of the agent is to replace something that would typically require a human operator. Development environments, browser infrastructure, large document processing — these all cost $$$.
3. They often involve input from a user (or another agent!) at some point in their execution cycle.
4. They spend a lot of time (a)waiting i/o or a human.

Let's translate this set of characteristics into something that resembles architecture. We're going to end up with a bunch of lightweight processes that are running concurrently, each representing the execution of an agent. Each process can be in a given state (for example, “Searching files,” “Generating code,” “Test”). Note that the ordering of states is not the same in for different agent executions.

This is quite different from a traditional web architecture of ~10 years ago, where thousands of daily users can be served efficiently using [some caches, efficient handlers and OLTP databases](https://nickcraver.com/blog/2013/11/22/what-it-takes-to-run-stack-overflow/).

It turns out, this shift in architecture is really well-suited to Go's concurrency model, reliance on channels for communication, centralized cancellation mechanism, and tooling built around i/o.

## High concurrency

Let's start with the obvious — Go has an incredibly simple and powerful concurrency model. Spawning a new goroutine costs very little memory and time, as there's only 2kb of pre-allocated memory per goroutine.

Effectively this means that you can run many goroutines at once with little overhead, and they run on _multiple OS threads_ under the hood which take advantage of all CPU cores in your server. This is rather important, because if you _happen_ to do something very CPU-intensive in a goroutine (like deserializing a large JSON payload), you will see less of an impact than if you were using a single-threaded runtime like Node.js (where you'd need to spawn out to a worker thread or child process for something that blocks the thread) or Python's async/await.

What does this mean for agents? Because agents are longer-running than a typical web request, concurrency becomes a much greater point of concern. In Go, you're much less likely to be constrained by spawning a goroutine per agent than if you ran a thread per agent in Python or an async function per agent in Node.js. Couple this with a lower baseline memory footprint and compilation into a single binary, and it becomes incredibly easy to run thousands of concurrent agent executions at the same time on lightweight infrastructure.

## Share memory by communicating

For those unaware, there's a common Go idiom that says: _Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating._

In practice, this means that instead of attempting to synchronize the contents of memory across many concurrent processes (a common problem when using something like Python's `multithreading` libraries), each process can acquire ownership over an object by acquiring and releasing it over a channel. The effect is that each process is only concerned about the local state of an object while it has ownership over that object, but otherwise doesn't need to coordinate ownership — no mutexes necessary!

To be quite honest -- in most Go programs I've written, I've often used wait groups and mutexes more often than channels, because it's often simpler (which is [in line](https://go.dev/wiki/MutexOrChannel) with the Go community's recommendations) and there's only one location where data gets accessed concurrently.

But this paradigm is useful when modeling agents, because an agent often needs to asynchronously respond to messages from a user or another agent, and it's helpful to think about an instance of your application as a pool of agents.

To make this more concrete, let's write some example code to represent the core of an agentic loop:

```go
// NOTE: in a real-world example, we'd want a mechanism to gracefully shut down the loop and protect against channel
// closure; this is a simplified example.
func Agent(in <-chan Message, out chan<- Output, status chan<- State) {
	internal := make(chan Message, 10)

	for {
		select {
		case msg := <-internal:
			processMessage(msg, internal, out, status)
		case msg := <-in:
			processMessage(msg, internal, out, status)
		}
	}
}

func processMessage(msg Message, internal chan<- Message, out chan<- Output, status chan<- State) {
	result := execute(msg)
	status <- State{msg.sessionId, result.status}

	if next := result.next(); next != nil {
		internal <- next
	}

	out <- result
}
```

(Note that the `<-chan` means that the receiver can _only read_ from the channel, while the `chan<-` means that the receiver can _only write_ to the channel.)

This agent is essentially long-running process which waits for messages to arrive on the `in` channel, processes the message, and then asynchronously sends the result to the `out` channel. The `status` channel is used to send updates about the agent's state, which can be useful for monitoring or sending incremental results to a user, while the `internal` channel is used to handle internal agent loops. For example, the internal loop could implement the "Until tests pass" loop in the diagram below:

Even though we're running the agent as a `for` loop, the instance of the agent doesn't have any internal state that it needs to maintain between messages. It's effectively a [stateless reducer](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-12-stateless-reducer.md), which doesn't depend on some internal state to make a decision about the next step in its execution path. Importantly, this means that _any instance of the agent is able to process the next message_. This also allows for the agent to use a durable boundary in between messages, for example writing messages to a database or message queue.

This is a toy example — for a more concrete walkthrough of this Go idiom, much of this is inspired by [this codewalk](https://go.dev/doc/codewalk/sharemem/).

## Centralized cancellation mechanism with `context.Context`

Remember how agents are expensive? Let's say a user triggers a $10 execution, and suddenly changes their mind and hits “stop generating” — to save yourself some money, you'd like to cancel the execution.

It turns out, cancelling long-running work in Node.js and Python is incredibly difficult for multiple reasons:

1. Libraries can't agree on a shared mechanism to actually cancel work — while both languages have support for abort signals and controllers, it doesn't guarantee that your third-party library calls will respect those signals.
2. If that fails, forcefully terminating threads [is a miserable process](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/323972/is-there-any-way-to-kill-a-thread) and can cause thread leakage or corrupted resources.

Luckily, Go's adoption of `context.Context` makes it arbitrary to cancel work, because the vast majority of libraries expect and respect this pattern. And even if they don't: because there's only one concurrency model in Go, there's a bunch of tooling like `goleak` which makes it much easier to catch leaking goroutines and problematic libraries.

## Expansive standard library

When you start working in Go, you'll immediately notice that the Go standard library is expansive and very high quality. Many parts of it are also built for web i/o — like `net/http`, `encoding/json` , and `crypto/tls` — which are useful for the core logic of your agent.

There's also an implicit assumption that all i/o is blocking within a goroutine — again, because there's only one way to run work concurrently — which encourages the core of your business logic to be written as [straight-line programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight-line_program). You don't need to worry about deferring execution to the scheduler with an `await` wrapping each function call.

Contrast this with Python: developers need to think about asyncio, multithreading, multiprocessing, eventlet, gevent, and some other patterns, and it's nearly impossible to support all concurrency models equally. As a result, if you're writing your agent in Python, you'll need to research each library's support for your concurrency model, and potentially adopt multiple patterns if your third-party libraries don't support exactly what you'd like.

(The story is much better in Node.js, though the addition of other runtimes like Bun and Deno has added some layers of incompatibility.)

## Profiling

Agents seem to be quite susceptible to memory leaks because of their statefulness and thread leaks because of the number of long-running processes. Go has great tooling in `runtime/pprof` for figuring out the source of a memory leak using the heap and alloc profiles, or the source of a goroutine leak using the goroutine profiles.

## The bad parts

Given all of these benefits, there are still a lot of reasons not to use Go for your agent:

1. Third-party support still lags behind Python and Typescript
2. Using Go for anything that involves real machine learning is nearly impossible
3. If you're looking for the _best performance possible_, there are better languages like Rust and C++
4. You're a maverick and don't like to handle errors
