# Run on Event

> This example assumes we have a [task](./your-first-task.mdx) registered on a running [worker](./workers.mdx).

Run-on-event allows you to trigger one or more tasks when a specific event occurs. This is useful when you need to execute a task in response to an ephemeral event where the result is not important. A few common use cases for event-triggered task runs are:

1. Running a task when an ephemeral event is received, such as a webhook or a message from a queue.
2. When you want to run multiple independent tasks in response to a single event. For instance, if you wanted to run a `send_welcome_email` task, and you also wanted to run a `grant_new_user_credits` task, and a `reward_referral` task, all triggered by the signup. In this case, you might declare all three of those tasks with an event trigger for `user:signup`, and then have them all kick off when that event happens.

<Callout type="info">
  Event triggers evaluate tasks to run at the time of the event. If an event is
  received before the task is registered, the task will not be run.
</Callout>

## Declaring Event Triggers

To run a task on an event, you need to declare the event that will trigger the task. This is done by declaring the `on_events` property in the task declaration.

<UniversalTabs items={["Python", "Typescript", "Go"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab title="Python">
    <Snippet src={snips.python.events.worker} block="event_trigger" />
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab title="Typescript">
    <Snippet
      src={snips.typescript.on_event.workflow}
      block="run_workflow_on_event"
    />
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab title="Go">
    <Snippet src={snips.go.workflows.on_event} block="run_workflow_on_event" />
  </Tabs.Tab>
</UniversalTabs>

<Callout type="info">
  Note: Multiple tasks can be triggered by the same event.
</Callout>

### Pushing an Event

You can push an event to the event queue by calling the `push` method on the Hatchet event client and providing the event name and payload.

<UniversalTabs items={["Python", "Typescript", "Go"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab title="Python">
    <Snippet src={snips.python.events.event} block="event_trigger" />
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab title="Typescript">
    <Snippet src={snips.typescript.on_event.event} block="pushing_an_event" />
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab title="Go">
    <Snippet src={snips.go.run.event} block="pushing_an_event" />
  </Tabs.Tab>
</UniversalTabs>

## Event Filtering

Events can also be _filtered_ in Hatchet, which allows you to push events to Hatchet and only trigger task runs from them in certain cases.

### Basic Usage

You can create event filters by using the `events` clients on the SDKs:

<UniversalTabs items={["Python", "Typescript", "Go"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab title="Python">
    <Snippet src={snips.python.events.filter} block="create_a_filter" />
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab title="Typescript">
    <Snippet src={snips.typescript.on_event.filter} block="create_a_filter" />
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab title="Go">
    <Snippet src={snips.go.run.event} block="create_a_filter" />
  </Tabs.Tab>
</UniversalTabs>

<Callout type="warning">
  Note the `scope` argument to the filter. When you create a filter, it must be
  given a `scope` which will be used by Hatchet internally to look it up. When
  you push events that you want filtered, you **must provide a `scope` with
  those events that matches the scope sent with the filter**. If you do not, the
  filter will not apply.
</Callout>

Then, push an event that uses the filter to determine whether or not to run. For instance, this run will be skipped, since the payload does not match the expression:

<UniversalTabs items={["Python", "Typescript", "Go"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab title="Python">
    <Snippet src={snips.python.events.filter} block="skip_a_run" />
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab title="Typescript">
    <Snippet src={snips.typescript.on_event.filter} block="skip_a_run" />
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab title="Go">
    <Snippet src={snips.go.run.event} block="skip_a_run" />
  </Tabs.Tab>
</UniversalTabs>

But this one will be triggered since the payload _does_ match the expression:

<UniversalTabs items={["Python", "Typescript", "Go"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab title="Python">
    <Snippet src={snips.python.events.filter} block="trigger_a_run" />
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab title="Typescript">
    <Snippet src={snips.typescript.on_event.filter} block="trigger_a_run" />
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab title="Go">
    <Snippet src={snips.go.run.event} block="trigger_a_run" />
  </Tabs.Tab>
</UniversalTabs>

<Callout type="info">
  In Hatchet, filters are "positive", meaning that we look for _matches_ to the
  filter to determine which tasks to trigger,
</Callout>

### Advanced Usage

In addition to specifying `input` in the expression (which corresponds to the _event_ payload), you can also provide the following fields:

1. `payload` corresponds to the _filter_ payload (which was part of the request when the filter was created).
2. `additional_metadata` allows for filtering based on `additional_metadata` sent with the event.
3. `event_key` allows for filtering based on the key of the event, such as `user:created`.
