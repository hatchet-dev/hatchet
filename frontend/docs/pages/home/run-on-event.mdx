# Run on Event

> This example assumes we have a [workflow](./basic-workflows.mdx) registered on a running [worker](./workers.mdx).

Run-on-event allows you to trigger one or more workflows when a specific event occurs. This is useful when you need to execute a workflow in response to an ephemeral event where the result is not important. A few common use cases for event-triggered workflow runs are:

1. Running a workflow when an ephemeral event is received, such as a webhook or a message from a queue.
2. When you want to run multiple independent workflows in response to a single event. For instance, if you wanted to run a `send_welcome_email` workflow, and you also wanted to run a `grant_new_user_credits` workflow, and a `reward_referral` workflow, all triggered by the signup. In this case, you might declare all three of those workflows with an event trigger for `user:signup`, and then have them all kick off when that event happens.

<Callout type="info">
  Event triggers evaluate workflows to run at the time of the event. If an event
  is received before the workflow is registered, the workflow will not be run.
</Callout>

## Declaring Event Triggers

To run a workflow on an event, you need to declare the event that will trigger the workflow. This is done by declaring the `on_events` property in the workflow declaration.

  <Tabs.Tab title="Python">
    <GithubSnippet src={EventPy} target="Event trigger" />
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab title="Typescript">
    <GithubSnippet src={SimpleTs} target="Run workflow on event" />
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab title="Go">
    <GithubSnippet src={EventGo} target="Run workflow on event" />
  </Tabs.Tab>
</UniversalTabs>

  Note: Multiple workflows can be triggered by the same event.
</Callout>

### Pushing an Event

You can push an event to the event queue by calling the `push` method on the Hatchet event client and providing the event name and payload.
