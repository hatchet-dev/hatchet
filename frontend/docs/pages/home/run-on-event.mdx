# Run on Event

> This example assumes we have a [task](./your-first-task.mdx) registered on a running [worker](./workers.mdx).

Run-on-event allows you to trigger one or more tasks when a specific event occurs. This is useful when you need to execute a task in response to an ephemeral event where the result is not important. A few common use cases for event-triggered task runs are:

1. Running a task when an ephemeral event is received, such as a webhook or a message from a queue.
2. When you want to run multiple independent tasks in response to a single event. For instance, if you wanted to run a `send_welcome_email` task, and you also wanted to run a `grant_new_user_credits` task, and a `reward_referral` task, all triggered by the signup. In this case, you might declare all three of those tasks with an event trigger for `user:signup`, and then have them all kick off when that event happens.

<Callout type="info">
  Event triggers evaluate tasks to run at the time of the event. If an event is
  received before the task is registered, the task will not be run.
</Callout>

## Declaring Event Triggers

To run a task on an event, you need to declare the event that will trigger the task. This is done by declaring the `on_events` property in the task declaration.

### Pushing an Event

You can push an event to the event queue by calling the `push` method on the Hatchet event client and providing the event name and payload.
