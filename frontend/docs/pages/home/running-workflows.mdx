# Running Workflows

Once you have a running worker, you'll want to run your workflows. Hatchet provides a number of ways of triggering workflow runs, from which you should select the one(s) that best suit(s) your use case.

1. Workflows can be [run, and have their results waited on](./run-with-results.mdx)
2. Workflows can be [enqueued without waiting for their results ("fire and forget")](./enqueue-runs.mdx).
3. Workflows can be run on [cron schedules](./cron-runs.mdx).
4. Workflows can be [triggered by events](./run-on-event.mdx).
5. Workflows can be [scheduled for a later time](./scheduled-runs.mdx).

Each of these methods for triggering workflows have their own uses in different scenarios, and the next few sections will give some examples of each.
