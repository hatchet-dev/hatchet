# Assigning priority to tasks in Hatchet

Hatchet allows you to assign different `priority` values to your tasks depending on how soon you want them to run. `priority` can be set to either `1`, `2`, or `3`, (`low`, `medium`, and `high`, respectively) with relatively higher values resulting in that task being picked up before others of the same type. **By default, runs in Hatchet have a priority of 1 (low) unless otherwise specified.**

Priority only affects multiple runs of a _single_ workflow. If you have two different workflows (A and B) and set A to globally have a priority of 3, and B to globally have a priority of 1, this does _not_ guarantee that if there is one task from A and one from B in the queue, that A's task will be run first.

However, _within_ A, if you enqueue one task with priority 3 and one with priority 1, the priority 3 task will be run first.

A couple of common use cases for assigning priorities are things like:

1. Having high-priority (e.g. paying, new, etc.) customers be prioritized over lower-priority ones, allowing them to get faster turnaround times on their tasks.
2. Having tasks triggered via your API run with higher priority than the same tasks triggered by a cron.

## Setting priority for a task or workflow

There are a few different ways to set priorities for tasks or workflows in Hatchet.

### Workflow-level default priority

First, you can set a default priority at the workflow level:

<UniversalTabs items={['Python', 'Typescript', 'Go']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>

<Snippet src={snippets.python.priority.worker.default_priority} />

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

<Snippet
  src={snippets.typescript.priority.workflow.task_priority_in_a_workflow}
/>

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    <Snippet src={snippets.go.workflows.priority.default_priority} />

  </Tabs.Tab>
</UniversalTabs>

This will assign the same default priority to all runs of this workflow (and all of the workflow's corresponding tasks), but will have no effect without also setting run-level priorities, since every run will use the same default.

### Priority-on-trigger

When you trigger a run, you can set the priority of the triggered run to override its default priority.

<UniversalTabs items={['Python', 'Typescript', 'Go']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>

<Snippet src={snippets.python.priority.trigger.runtime_priority} />

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

<Snippet src={snippets.typescript.priority.run.run_a_task_with_a_priority} />

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    <Snippet src={snippets.go.run.priority.running_a_task_with_priority} />

  </Tabs.Tab>
</UniversalTabs>

Similarly, you can also assign a priority to scheduled and cron workflows.

<UniversalTabs items={['Python', 'Typescript', 'Go']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>

<Snippet src={snippets.python.priority.trigger.scheduled_priority} />

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

<Snippet src={snippets.typescript.priority.run.schedule_and_cron} />

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    <Snippet src={snippets.go.run.priority.schedule_and_cron} />

  </Tabs.Tab>
</UniversalTabs>

In these cases, the priority set on the trigger will override the default priority, so these runs will be processed ahead of lower-priority ones.
