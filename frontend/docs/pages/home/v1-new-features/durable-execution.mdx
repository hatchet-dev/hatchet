## Introduction

Hatchet V1 supports a new set of durable execution features that build off of the [conditions listed above](#complex--conditional-workflow-logic). In the V1 SDKs, you can now call `context.wait_for` to durably wait for either an event or a sleep condition to complete before continuing your task.

  If you register any durable tasks, the Hatchet SDK will run a second "durable" worker when starting your main worker for running the durable tasks. This durable worker will show up as a second worker in the Hatchet Dashboard.

**If you register _any_ durable tasks on a workflow, _all_ of the tasks in that workflow will be run by the durable worker.**

</Callout>

## Example Workflow

Let's start by declaring a workflow that will run durably, on the "durable worker".

<GithubSnippet src={DurablePy} target="Create a durable workflow" />

Here, we've declared a Hatchet workflow just like any other. Now, we can add some tasks to it:

<GithubSnippet src={DurablePy} target="Add durable task" />

We've added two tasks to our workflow. The first is a normal, "ephemeral" task, which does not leverage any of Hatchet's durable features. **Importantly, as mentioned above, this task will still be run by the durable worker.**

Second, we've added a durable task, which we've created by using the `durable_task` method of the `Workflow`, as opposed to the `task` method.

The durable task first waits for a sleep condition. Once the sleep has completed, it continues processing until it hits the second `wait_for`. At this point, it needs to wait for an event condition. Once it receives the event, the task prints `Event received` and completes.
