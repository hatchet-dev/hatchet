# Task Orchestration

Not only can you run a single task in Hatchet, but you can also orchestrate multiple tasks together based on a shape that you define. For example, you can run a task that depends on the output of another task, or you can run a task that waits for a certain condition to be met before running.

1. [Declarative Workflow Design (DAGs)](./dags.mdx) -- which is a way to declaratively define the sequence and dependencies of tasks in a workflow when you know the dependencies ahead of time.
2. [Procedural Child Spawning](./child-spawning.mdx) -- which is a way to orchestrate tasks in a workflow when you don't know the dependencies ahead of time or when the dependencies are dynamic.

To read about waiting on additional conditions in a workflow, see the [Conditional Workflows](./conditional-workflows.mdx) guide.
