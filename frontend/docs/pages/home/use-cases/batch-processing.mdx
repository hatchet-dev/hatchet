# Batch Processing

Process **thousands of items in parallel** — images, documents, records, API calls — with automatic retry, concurrency control, and real-time progress tracking. Hatchet distributes work across your worker fleet and handles failures without losing progress.

## Why Hatchet for Batch Processing

<Steps>

### Massive parallelism

A parent task fans out to one child per item. Hatchet distributes these across all available workers automatically. Scale from 10 to 100,000 items without changing your code — just add more workers.

### No lost work

Each item is an independent task. If one fails, Hatchet retries just that item — the other 9,999 continue running. You can also bulk-retry all failed items from the dashboard with a single click.

### Resource control

Concurrency limits prevent overwhelming your infrastructure. Rate limits protect external APIs. Priority queues let urgent batches cut ahead. You get predictable resource usage even at massive scale.

</Steps>

## Key Features

| Feature | What it does for batch processing |
|---------|----------------------------------|
| **[Child Spawning](/home/child-spawning)** | Fan out to one task per item with automatic distribution across workers |
| **[Bulk Run](/home/bulk-run)** | Trigger thousands of tasks in a single API call |
| **[Retry Policies](/home/retry-policies)** | Retry failed items individually without restarting the batch |
| **[Bulk Retries](/home/bulk-retries-and-cancellations)** | Re-run all failed items from the dashboard |
| **[Concurrency](/home/concurrency)** | Limit how many items process simultaneously |
| **[Rate Limits](/home/rate-limits)** | Throttle external API calls across all workers |
| **[Priority](/home/priority)** | Urgent batches jump ahead of lower-priority work |
| **[Autoscaling](/home/autoscaling-workers)** | Scale workers up during batch processing, down when idle |

<Callout type="info">
  The batch processing pattern is [Fanout](/home/patterns/fanout) applied at scale. For fixed multi-stage processing (e.g., validate → transform → load), combine with [Pre-Determined Pipelines](/home/patterns/pre-determined-pipelines).
</Callout>

## Architecture

<Steps>

### Trigger the batch

Start a parent workflow with the batch input — a list of item IDs, file paths, or records. This can come from an API call, event, cron schedule, or the dashboard.

### Fan out to workers

The parent task iterates over the input and spawns one child task per item. For very large batches (10,000+ items), use `BulkRunChild` for optimized dispatching.

### Process items

Each child task processes its item independently — calling external APIs, transforming data, writing results. Failed items are retried according to your retry policy.

### Collect results

The parent awaits all children and aggregates results. You can see the status of every item in real-time in the Hatchet dashboard.

</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
  For batches with thousands of items, use **durable workflows** so the parent task doesn't hold a worker slot while waiting for all children to complete. See [Durable Workflows](/home/durable-workflows-overview) for details.
</Callout>

## Common Batch Patterns

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **Image processing** | Resize, transcode, or analyze images in parallel across workers |
| **Data enrichment** | Enrich records by calling external APIs (geocoding, company info, email validation) |
| **Report generation** | Generate per-customer reports in parallel, then aggregate into a summary |
| **Database migrations** | Process and migrate records in batches with retry and progress tracking |
| **Notification delivery** | Send emails, SMS, or push notifications to a user list with rate limiting |
