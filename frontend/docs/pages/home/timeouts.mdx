# Timeouts in Hatchet

Timeouts are an important concept in Hatchet that allow you to control how long a task is allowed to run before it is considered to have failed. This is useful for ensuring that your tasks don't run indefinitely and consume unnecessary resources. Timeouts in Hatchet are treated as failures and the task will be [retried](./retry-policies.mdx) if specified.

There are two types of timeouts in Hatchet:

1. **Scheduling Timeouts** (Default 5m) - the time a task is allowed to wait in the queue before it is cancelled
2. **Execution Timeouts** (Default 60s) - the time a task is allowed to run before it is considered to have failed

## Timeout Format

In Hatchet, timeouts are specified using a string in the format `<number><unit>`, where `<number>` is an integer and `<unit>` is one of:

- `s` for seconds
- `m` for minutes
- `h` for hours

For example:

- `10s` means 10 seconds
- `4m` means 4 minutes
- `1h` means 1 hour

If no unit is specified, seconds are assumed.

<Callout type="info">
  In the Python SDK, timeouts can also be specified as a `datetime.timedelta`
  object.
</Callout>

### Task-Level Timeouts

You can specify execution and scheduling timeouts for a task using the `execution_timeout` and `schedule_timeout` parameters when creating a task.

<UniversalTabs items={['Python', 'Typescript']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  <Snippet src={snips.python.timeout.worker.executiontimeout} />

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  <Snippet src={snips.typescript.with_timeouts.workflow.execution_timeout} />

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  <GithubSnippet src={TimeoutGo} target="TimeoutStep" />

  </Tabs.Tab>
</UniversalTabs>

In these tasks, both timeouts are specified, meaning:

1. If the task is not scheduled before the `schedule_timeout` is reached, it will be cancelled.
2. If the task does not complete before the `execution_timeout` is reached (after starting), it will be cancelled.

<Callout type="warning">
  A timed out step does not guarantee that the step will be stopped immediately.
  The step will be stopped as soon as the worker is able to stop the step. See
  [cancellation](./cancellation.mdx) for more information.
</Callout>

## Refreshing Timeouts

In some cases, you may need to extend the timeout for a step while it is running. This can be done using the `refreshTimeout` method provided by the step context (`ctx`).

For example:

<UniversalTabs items={['Python', 'Typescript']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  <Snippet src={snips.python.timeout.worker.refreshtimeout} />

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  <Snippet src={snips.typescript.with_timeouts.workflow.refresh_timeout} />
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  <GithubSnippet src={TimeoutGo} target="RefreshTimeout" />
  </Tabs.Tab>
</UniversalTabs>

In this example, the step initially would exceed its execution timeout. But before it does, we call the `refreshTimeout` method, which extends the timeout and allows it to complete. Importantly, refreshing a timeout is an additive operation - the new timeout is added to the existing timeout. So for instance, if the task originally had a timeout of `30s` and we call `refreshTimeout("15s")`, the new timeout will be `45s`.

The `refreshTimeout` function can be called multiple times within a step to further extend the timeout as needed.

## Use Cases

Timeouts are useful in a variety of scenarios:

- Ensuring tasks don't run indefinitely and consume unnecessary resources
- Failing tasks early if a critical step takes too long
- Keeping tasks responsive by ensuring individual steps complete in a timely manner
- Preventing infinite loops or hung processes from blocking the entire system

For example, if you have a task that makes an external API call, you may want to set a timeout to ensure the task fails quickly if the API is unresponsive, rather than waiting indefinitely.

By carefully considering timeouts for your tasks and steps, you can build more resilient and responsive systems with Hatchet.
