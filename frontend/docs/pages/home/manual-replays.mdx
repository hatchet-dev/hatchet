# Manual Retries

In addition to [automatic task-level retries](./simple.mdx), Hatchet provides a manual retry mechanism that allows you to handle failed workflow instances flexibly from the Hatchet dashboard.

Navigate to the specific workflow in the Hatchet dashboard and click on the failed run. From there, you can inspect the details of the run, including the input data and the failure reason for each task.

To retry a failed task, simply click on the task in the run details view and then click the "Replay" button. This will create a new instance of the workflow, starting from the failed task, and using the same input data as the original run.

Manual retries give you full control over when and how to reprocess failed instances. For example, you may choose to wait until an external service is back online before retrying instances that depend on that service, or you may need to deploy a bug fix to your workflow code before retrying instances that were affected by the bug.

## Bulk Retries

As of [Hatchet V1](../announcement.mdx), you can also retry tasks in bulk from the dashboard. There are two ways to achieve this:

1. Select any number of rows in the table of task and workflow runs in the dashboard to replay, and then hit the `Replay` button to replay them. You'll be asked for confirmation.
2. If you hit replay _without_ selecting rows, you'll see a modal showing you filters you can apply to decide which runs to replay. This allows you to replay tasks based on status, workflow name, additional metadata, and so on.

## A Note on Dead Letter Queues

A dead letter queue (DLQ) is a messaging concept used to handle messages that cannot be processed successfully. In the context of workflow management, a DLQ can be used to store failed workflow instances that require manual intervention or further analysis.

While Hatchet does not have a built-in dead letter queue feature, the persistence of failed workflow instances in the dashboard serves a similar purpose. By keeping a record of failed instances, Hatchet allows you to track and manage failures, perform root cause analysis, and take appropriate actions, such as modifying input data or updating your workflow code before manually retrying the failed instances.

It's important to note that the term "dead letter queue" is more commonly associated with messaging systems like Apache Kafka or Amazon SQS, where unprocessed messages are automatically moved to a separate queue for manual handling. In Hatchet, the failed instances are not automatically moved to a separate queue but are instead persisted in the dashboard for manual management.
