# Running from External Services

Hatchet allows you to run workflows from external services. This is useful when you need to trigger a workflow from an external service, such as an API, or triggering workflows across multiple languages (i.e. Python, Typescript, Go).

There are three ways to run workflows from external services:

1. [Declaring an External Workflow Reference](#declaring-an-external-workflow-reference)
2. [Client Run Methods](#client-run-methods)
3. [Event Pushing](#event-pushing)

## Declaring an External Workflow Reference (Recommended)

The recommended way to run workflows from external services in most cases is to create an external workflow reference. An external workflow reference is the minimal amount of code needed to declare a workflow that matches the declaration on the worker (i.e. name and input/output types).

The resulting external workflow reference exposes the same run methods as the workflow declaration on the worker (i.e. `run`, `enqueue`, `schedule`, etc).

      }
    />
  </Tabs.Tab>

</UniversalTabs>

<Callout variant="info">
  Note: In a single-language monorepo, you can share a full workflow declaration
  between the worker and the external service. Take care on the external service
  not to add tasks or modify the workflow as these changes will not be reflected
  on the worker.
</Callout>

## Client Run Methods

The client exposes the same run methods as the workflow declaration on the worker, but can be called with just the workflow name and an untyped input.

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab title="Go">TODO V1 DOCS</Tabs.Tab>
</UniversalTabs>

## Event Pushing

[Event pushing](./run-on-event.mdx) is a way to trigger workflows which have registered an [`on_event` trigger](./run-on-event.mdx) from external services without needing any of the workflow structure. It is useful when you need to trigger multiple workflows from an external service.

      `push` supports optional input typing for the event payload.
