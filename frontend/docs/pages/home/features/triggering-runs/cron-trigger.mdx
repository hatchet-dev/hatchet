# Triggering Workflows with Cron in Hatchet

Hatchet provides a flexible and powerful way to trigger workflows based on a schedule using cron expressions. Cron is a time-based job scheduler that allows you to define when a workflow should be executed automatically. This feature is particularly useful for recurring tasks, such as daily data updates, weekly reports, or periodic maintenance jobs.

## Configuring Cron Triggers

To trigger a workflow with a cron schedule, you need to configure the `on` property in the workflow definition. Here's an example of how to define a cron trigger:

```typescript
const myWorkflow: Workflow = {
  id: 'my-workflow',
  description: 'A workflow triggered by a cron schedule',
  on: {
    cron: '0 0 * * *', // Run every day at midnight
  },
  steps: [
    // Define your workflow steps here
  ],
};
```

In this example, the `on` property is set to an object with a `cron` property. The `cron` property specifies the cron expression that determines when the workflow should be triggered.

## Cron Expression Syntax

Cron expressions in Hatchet follow the standard cron syntax. A cron expression consists of five fields separated by spaces:

```
┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
│ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
│ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)
│ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12)
│ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0 - 6) (Sunday to Saturday)
│ │ │ │ │
│ │ │ │ │
* * * * *
```

Each field can contain a specific value, an asterisk (`*`) to represent all possible values, or a range of values. Here are some examples of cron expressions:

- `0 0 * * *`: Run every day at midnight
- `*/15 * * * *`: Run every 15 minutes
- `0 9 * * 1`: Run every Monday at 9 AM
- `0 0 1 * *`: Run on the first day of every month at midnight

## Scheduling Considerations

When using cron triggers, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:

1. **Time Zone**: Cron schedules are based on the time zone configured in your Hatchet instance. Make sure to consider the time zone when defining your cron expressions.

2. **Execution Time**: The actual execution time of a cron-triggered workflow may vary slightly from the scheduled time. Hatchet makes a best-effort attempt to start the workflow as close to the scheduled time as possible, but there may be slight delays due to system load or other factors.

3. **Missed Schedules**: If a scheduled workflow is missed (e.g., due to system downtime), Hatchet will not automatically run the missed instances. It will wait for the next scheduled time to trigger the workflow.

4. **Overlapping Schedules**: If a workflow is still running when the next scheduled time arrives, Hatchet will not start a new instance of the workflow. It will wait for the current instance to complete before triggering the next scheduled run.
