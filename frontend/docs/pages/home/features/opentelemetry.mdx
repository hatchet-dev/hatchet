# OpenTelemetry

Hatchet supports exporting traces from your workflows to an [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) to improve visibility into your Hatchet tasks.

## Exporting Traces from Hatchet

To export traces from Hatchet, all you'll need to do is set the following environment variables:

```
HATCHET_CLIENT_OTEL_SERVICE_NAME
HATCHET_CLIENT_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL
HATCHET_CLIENT_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
HATCHET_CLIENT_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS
```

Once set, Hatchet will read your exporter configuration from those variables, and traces will begin to populate in your collector.

## Example Setup

For example, if you're already using an observability platform like [Honeycomb](https://www.honeycomb.io/), you'd set the variables as follows:

```
export HATCHET_CLIENT_OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=hello-from-hatchet
export HATCHET_CLIENT_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/protobuf
export HATCHET_CLIENT_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://api.honeycomb.io/v1/traces"
export HATCHET_CLIENT_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS='{"x-honeycomb-team": "<< your-api-key >>"}'
```

## Usage

### Sending Metadata

Any metadata that you send to Hatchet with the additional metadata will be sent along to your collector as attributes of the parent span in any traces that are created by your workflows:

{/* <Tabs items={['Python', 'Typescript', 'Go']}> */}
<Tabs items={['Python']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```python
hatchet.event.push("user:create", {'userId': '1234'}, options={
    "additional_metadata": {
        "hello": "world" # Set as attribute of parent span with key: hello, value: world
    }
})
        ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  {/* <Tabs.Tab>
```typescript
hatchet.event.push(
'user:create',
{
    test: 'test',
},
{
    additionalMetadata: {
        hello: 'world', // Set as attribute of parent span with key: hello, value: world
    },
}
);
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```go
err := c.Event().Push(
    context.Background(),
    "user:create",
    testEvent,
    client.WithEventMetadata(map[string]string{
        "hello": "world", // Set as attribute of parent span with key: hello, value: world
    }),
)
```
  </Tabs.Tab> */}
</Tabs>

### Providing a `traceparent`

In some cases, you might also want to provide a `traceparent` so any spans created in Hatchet are children of a parent that was created elsewhere in your application. You can do that by providing an `__otel_carrier` key:

{/* <Tabs items={['Python', 'Typescript', 'Go']}> */}
<Tabs items={['Python']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```python
hatchet.event.push("user:create", {'userId': '1234'}, options={
    "additional_metadata": {
        "__otel_carrier": {"traceparent":"00-f1aff5c5ea45185eff2a06fd5c0ed6c5-6f4116aff54d54d1-01"} ## example traceparent
    }
})
        ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  {/* <Tabs.Tab>
```typescript
hatchet.event.push(
'user:create',
{
    test: 'test',
},
{
    additionalMetadata: {
        __otel_carrier: {
            traceparent: '00-f1aff5c5ea45185eff2a06fd5c0ed6c5-6f4116aff54d54d1-01', // example traceparent
        }
    },
}
);
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```go
err := c.Event().Push(
    context.Background(),
    "user:create",
    testEvent,
    client.WithEventMetadata(map[string]string{
        "__otel_carrier": "{\"traceparent\":\"00-f1aff5c5ea45185eff2a06fd5c0ed6c5-6f4116aff54d54d1-01\"}", // example traceparent
    }),
)
```
  </Tabs.Tab> */}
</Tabs>

### Spans

By default, Hatchet creates spans at the following points in the lifecycle of a workflow run:

1. When a trigger is run on the client side, e.g. `run_workflow()` or `push()` is called.
2. When the task is picked up by a worker.
3. When the worker runs the task.

In addition, a number of events and attributes are set in each span, such as events marking work being started and completed.

### Bulk Events

If you send bulk events, a `bulk_push_correlation_id` will be set on the parent span of each trace, allowing you to correlate traces that are part of the same bulk event.
