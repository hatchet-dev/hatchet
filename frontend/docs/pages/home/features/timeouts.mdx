# Timeouts in Hatchet

Timeouts are an important concept in Hatchet that allow you to control how long a workflow or step is allowed to run before it is considered to have failed. This is useful for ensuring that your workflows don't run indefinitely and consume unnecessary resources.

## Timeout Format

In Hatchet, timeouts are specified using a string in the format `<number><unit>`, where `<number>` is an integer and `<unit>` is one of:

- `s` for seconds
- `m` for minutes
- `h` for hours
- `d` for days

For example:

- `10s` means 10 seconds
- `4m` means 4 minutes
- `1h` means 1 hour
- `2d` means 2 days

If no unit is specified, seconds are assumed.

## Default Timeout

By default, if no timeout is specified for a workflow or step, a timeout of 60 seconds is used. This means that if a workflow or step takes longer than 60 seconds to complete, it will be considered to have failed.

## Specifying Timeouts

Timeouts can be specified at both the workflow and step level:

### Workflow Timeouts

To specify a timeout for an entire workflow, you can set the `timeout` property in the workflow definition:

```typescript
const myWorkflow: Workflow = {
  id: "my-workflow",
  // ...
  timeout: "2m",
  // ...
};
```

This would set a timeout of 2 minutes for the entire workflow. If the workflow takes longer than 2 minutes to complete, it will fail.

### Step Timeouts

To specify a timeout for an individual step, you can set the `timeout` property in the step definition:

```typescript
const myStep: CreateStep<any, any> = {
  name: "my-step",
  // ...
  timeout: "30s",
  run: async (ctx) => {
    // ...
  },
};
```

This would set a timeout of 30 seconds for this specific step. If the step takes longer than 30 seconds to complete, it will fail.

## Refreshing Timeouts

In some cases, you may need to extend the timeout for a step while it is running. This can be done using the `refreshTimeout` function provided by the step context (`ctx`).

For example:

```typescript
const myStep: CreateStep<any, any> = {
  name: "my-step",
  timeout: "30s",
  run: async (ctx) => {
    await sleep(20 * 1000);
    ctx.refreshTimeout("15s");
    await sleep(10 * 1000);
    return { step1: "step1 results!" };
  },
};
```

In this example, the step initially has a timeout of 30 seconds. After 19 seconds, the `refreshTimeout` function is called with an argument of `'15s'`, which extends the timeout by an additional 15 seconds. This allows the step to continue running for a total of 45 seconds (30 seconds initial timeout + 15 seconds refreshed timeout).

The `refreshTimeout` function can be called multiple times within a step to further extend the timeout as needed.

## Use Cases

Timeouts are useful in a variety of scenarios:

- Ensuring workflows don't run indefinitely and consume unnecessary resources
- Failing workflows early if a critical step takes too long
- Keeping workflows responsive by ensuring individual steps complete in a timely manner
- Preventing infinite loops or hung processes from blocking the entire system

For example, if you have a workflow that makes an external API call, you may want to set a timeout to ensure the workflow fails quickly if the API is unresponsive, rather than waiting indefinitely.

By carefully considering timeouts for your workflows and steps, you can build more resilient and responsive systems with Hatchet.
