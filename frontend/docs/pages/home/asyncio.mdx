# Working with `asyncio`

Hatchet's Python SDK, similarly to other popular libraries like FastAPI, Langchain, etc., makes heavy use of `asyncio`, and recommends that you do as well!

  FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/async/).

However, as is the case in FastAPI, when using `asyncio` in Hatchet, you need to be careful to not have any blocking logic in the functions you define as tasks, as this will block the asyncio event loop and prevent additional work from executing until the blocking operation has completed.

For example, this is async-safe:

```python
import asyncio

async def my_task() -> int:
    await asyncio.sleep(5)

    return 42
```

But this is not:

```python
async def my_task() -> int:
    time.sleep(5)

    return 42
```

In the second case, your worker will not be able to process any other work that's defined as async until the five-second sleep has finished.

### Using `asyncio.to_thread` and `loop.run_in_executor`

To avoid problems caused by blocking code, you can run your blocking code in an executor with `asyncio.to_thread` or, more verbosely, `loop.run_in_executor`. The two examples below are async-safe and will no longer block the event loop.

```python
import asyncio

async def my_task() -> int:
    await asyncio.to_thread(time.sleep, 5)

    return 42
```

```python
import asyncio

async def my_task() -> int:
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()

    await loop.run_in_executor(None, time.sleep, 5)

    return 42
```
