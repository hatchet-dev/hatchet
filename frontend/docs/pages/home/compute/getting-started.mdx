# Getting Started with Hatchet Compute

Hatchet Compute is available in [Hatchet Cloud](https://cloud.onhatchet.run).

All Free tier users with a linked card receive $5/month in free compute credits to get started.

## Quickstart

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a Hatchet Compute project and assumes you have a basic understanding of Hatchet.
If you'd like you can fork the [Hatchet Compute Example Repo](https://github.com/hatchet-dev/managed-compute-examples) to follow along.

1. Sign in or sign up for Hatchet Cloud [here](https://cloud.onhatchet.run).
2. Navigate to the Managed Compute view to configure your compute resources.
3. Ensure your code is committed to a Git repository.
4. Click **+ Add Service** to create a new managed compute service.
5. Connect your Git Hub repository to Hatchet and select the repository and branch you'd like to deploy.
6. Specify the directory where your Dockerfile is located.
7. Select Infrastructure as Code to have Hatchet automatically manage your compute resources based on your workflow code, or select Manual to manage your compute resources through the Hatchet UI.
8. Click **Deploy** to deploy your workflow.

Your service will be deployed and you'll be able to monitor and scale your compute resources through the Hatchet UI.
