# GitOps with Hatchet Compute

Hatchet Compute uses GitOps principles to manage and deploy your services. This approach ensures that your infrastructure configuration is version controlled, reproducible, and follows best practices for continuous deployment.

<Callout type="info">
  GitHub accounts must have read access to a repository to configure worker
  pools. Make sure your GitHub account has the necessary permissions before
  proceeding.
</Callout>

## Overview

GitOps in Hatchet Compute means that:

- Your service configuration lives in your Git repository
- Changes to your service are triggered by Git events
- The deployed state always matches your Git repository's state
- You have a complete audit trail of all service changes

## Build Configuration

### Repository Setup

1. **Github Account**

   - Select your GitHub account from the dropdown
   - If your account isn't listed, click "Link a new repository" to connect your GitHub account
   - Hatchet requires GitHub repository access to enable GitOps workflows

2. **Github Repository**

   - Choose the repository containing your service code
   - The repository should contain your application code and Dockerfile(s)
   - Ensure Hatchet has the necessary permissions to access your repository

3. **Github Branch**
   - Select the branch you want to deploy from
   - This branch will be monitored for changes
   - Any commits to this branch will trigger new deployments
   - Note: You can configure Dev/Prod branches to deploy to different services with [namespaces or tenants](../environments.mdx)

### Build Settings

1. **Build Directory**

   - Specify the directory containing your service code
   - This is the root directory where your build will run
   - Example: `.` for repository root, or `services/myservice` for a monorepo

2. **Path to Dockerfile(s)**
   - Provide the relative path to your Dockerfile
   - Default: `./Dockerfile`
   - The path is relative to your build directory
   - You can maintain multiple Dockerfiles for different worker configurations:
     ```
     .
     ├── Dockerfile.worker1        # For worker pool 1
     ├── Dockerfile.worker2        # For worker pool 2
     └── services/
         └── special/
             └── Dockerfile        # For specialized worker
     ```

## Docker Configuration

Your Dockerfile needs to be properly configured to run Hatchet workers. See our [Docker configuration guide](../docker.mdx) for:

- Language-specific Dockerfile examples (Python, JavaScript, Go)
- Package manager configurations (pip, poetry, npm, yarn, pnpm)
- Entry point configuration
- Multi-stage build optimizations

<Callout type="info">
  When using multiple worker configurations in the same repository, you can
  create separate Dockerfiles with different dependencies, environment
  variables, and entry points for each worker pool.
</Callout>

## Best Practices

1. **Example Repository Structure**

   ```
   .
   ├── Dockerfile.worker1          # Primary worker configuration
   ├── Dockerfile.worker2          # Secondary worker configuration
   ├── .dockerignore
   ├── src/
   │   ├── worker1/               # Worker 1 specific code
   │   │   └── worker.py
   │   └── worker2/               # Worker 2 specific code
   │       └── worker.py
   └── hatchet.yaml               # Optional Hatchet configuration
   ```

2. **Dockerfile Guidelines**

   - Use multi-stage builds to optimize image size
   - Specify exact versions for base images
   - Include only necessary files using `.dockerignore`
   - Set appropriate user permissions
   - Cache dependencies effectively

3. **Branch Management**

   - Use feature branches for development
   - Set up branch protection rules
   - Consider using environment-specific branches (e.g., `main` for production, `staging` for staging)

4. **Security**
   - Never commit secrets to your repository
   - Use Hatchet's secrets management for sensitive data
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Scan your containers for vulnerabilities

## Continuous Deployment

Hatchet automatically sets up a continuous deployment pipeline that:

1. Monitors your selected branch for changes
2. Triggers a new build when changes are detected
3. Builds your Docker image using the specified Dockerfile
4. Deploys the new image to your compute environment
5. Updates your service with zero downtime

## Monitoring Deployments

You can monitor your deployments in the Hatchet UI:

1. View build status and logs
2. See deployment history
3. Track service health metrics
4. Monitor resource utilization

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Build Failures**

   - Check your Dockerfile syntax
   - Verify build context is correct
   - Ensure all required files are included
   - Review build logs in the Hatchet UI

2. **Permission Issues**

   - Verify GitHub repository access for Hatchet users who need to manage configuration
   - Ensure correct branch configuration for your service

3. **Deployment Problems**
   - Validate your container configuration
   - Check resource limits and requests
   - Review service logs
   - Verify network connectivity
