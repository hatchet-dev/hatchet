# Pushing Events

Events can be pushed via the client's `hatchet.event.push()` method:

```ts
import Hatchet from "@hatchet/sdk";

const hatchet = Hatchet.init();

hatchet.event.push("user:create", {
  test: "test",
});
```

Events should be JSON serializable and typically utilize a `Record` or a type that serializes into a JSON object in TypeScript.
