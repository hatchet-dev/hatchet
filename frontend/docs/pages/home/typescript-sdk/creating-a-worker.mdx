# Creating a Worker

Workers can be created via the `hatchet.run()` method, after instantiating a `hatchet` instance.
It will automatically read in any `HATCHET_CLIENT` environment variables, which can be set in the process by using something like `dotenv`.

For example:

```ts
import Hatchet from "@hatchet/sdk";
import { Workflow } from "@hatchet/sdk";

const hatchet = Hatchet.init();

// workflow code...

hatchet.run(workflow);
```

## Advanced Usage

The `hatchet.run(workflow)` method will return a reference to the `Worker` object.

You could then stop the worker:

```ts
const worker = hatchet.run(workflow);
worker.stop();
```

Alternatively, you can create a worker object with `hatchet.worker()` and manually start the service.

```ts
const worker = hatchet.worker(workflow);
worker.start();
```
