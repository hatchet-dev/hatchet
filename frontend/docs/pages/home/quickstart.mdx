# Quickstart

Welcome to Hatchet! This guide walks you through getting set up on Hatchet Cloud. If you'd like to self-host Hatchet, please see the [self-hosted quickstart](/self-hosting/quickstart) instead.

## Step 1 - Request Access

If you haven't already requested access to Hatchet Cloud, please fill out the form [here](https://hatchet.run/request-access). We'll get back to you within 1 business day.

## Step 2 - Set up your Development Tenant

Each Hatchet instance runs on a unique subdomain for your organization (e.g. `mycompany.onhatchet.run`). Within each instance, you can create multiple tenants to logically separate your environments (e.g. `dev`, `staging`, `production`). Each tenant has its own set of users who can access it.

When you get access to Hatchet, you'll be given a development tenant to use. This will allow you to create your development workflows and invite your team members to collaborate. We recommend utilizing a different development tenant for each engineer on your team.

When you get access to the tenant, navigate to your Hatchet dashboard and to your settings tab. You should see a section called "API Keys". Click "Create API Key", input a name for the key and copy the key. Then set the following environment variables:

```sh
HATCHET_CLIENT_HOST_PORT=<hatchet-domain>:443
HATCHET_CLIENT_TOKEN="<your-api-key>"
```

## Step 3 - Execute your first workflow

<Tabs items={['Python', 'Typescript']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

```sh
pip install python-dotenv
pip install hatchet-sdk
```

We are using [`python-dotenv`](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) to load the environment variables from a `.env` file. This isn't required, and you can use your own method to load environment variables.

Create a `worker.py` file with the following contents:

```python filename="worker.py" copy
from hatchet_sdk import Hatchet
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

hatchet = Hatchet(debug=True)

@hatchet.workflow(name="first-python-workflow",on_events=["user:create"])
class MyWorkflow:
    @hatchet.step()
    def step1(self, context):
        return {
            "result": "success"
        }

worker = hatchet.worker('first-worker')
worker.register_workflow(MyWorkflow())

worker.start()
```

Open a new terminal and start the worker with:

```sh
python3 worker.py
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
Make sure you install `@hatchet-dev/typescript-sdk` via:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @hatchet-dev/typescript-sdk
```

Copy the following code into a `worker.ts` file:

```typescript filename="worker.ts" copy
import Hatchet from '@hatchet-dev/typescript-sdk';
import { Workflow } from '@hatchet-dev/typescript-sdk/dist/workflow';

const hatchet = Hatchet.init();

const workflow: Workflow = {
  id: 'first-typescript-workflow',
  description: 'This is my first workflow',
  on: {
    event: 'user:create',
  },
  steps: [
    {
      name: 'step1',
      run: async (ctx) => {
        console.log('starting step1 with the following input', ctx.workflowInput());

        return { 
            result: 'success!' };
      },
    },
  ],
};

hatchet.run(workflow);
```

Next, modify your `package.json` to include a script to start:

```json
{
    // ...rest of your `package.json`
    "scripts": {
        // ...existing scripts
        "worker": "npx dotenv -- ts-node <path-to-worker.ts>"
    }
}
```

Now to start the worker, in a new terminal run:
```sh
npx run worker
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

The worker is now running and listening for steps to execute. You should see your first worker registered in the `Workers` tab of the Hatchet dashboard:

You can now trigger this workflow by clicking the top right "Trigger workflow" button when viewing the workflow:

![Quickstart 2](/quickstart-2.png)

There are multiple ways you can interact with Hatchet workflows:
- Trigger workflows from your existing APIs
- Trigger workflows from the dashboard
- Replay steps in workflows from the dashboard

## Next Steps

Now that you have your first workflow running, you can start to build more complex workflows and integrate them into your existing systems. Check out the language-specific SDKs for more information on how to build workflows.
