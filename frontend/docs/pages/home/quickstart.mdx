# Quickstart

Welcome to Hatchet! This guide walks you through getting set up on Hatchet Cloud. If you'd like to self-host Hatchet, please see the [self-hosted quickstart](/self-hosting/quickstart) instead.

## Step 1 - Request Access

If you haven't already requested access to Hatchet Cloud, please fill out the form [here](https://hatchet.run/request-access). We'll get back to you within 1 business day.

## Step 2 - Set up your Development Tenant

Each Hatchet instance runs on a unique subdomain for your organization (e.g. `mycompany.onhatchet.run`). Within each instance, you can create multiple tenants to logically separate your environments (e.g. `dev`, `staging`, `production`). Each tenant has its own set of users who can access it.

When you get access to Hatchet, you'll be given a development tenant to use. This will allow you to create your development workflows and invite your team members to collaborate. We recommend utilizing a different development tenant for each engineer on your team.

When you get access to the tenant, navigate to your Hatchet dashboard and to your settings tab. You should see a section called "API Keys". Click "Create API Key", input a name for the key and copy the key. Then set the following environment variables:

```sh
HATCHET_CLIENT_HOST_PORT=<hatchet-domain>:443
HATCHET_CLIENT_TOKEN="<your-api-key>"
```

## Step 3 - Execute your first workflow

  <Tabs.Tab>
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

```sh
pip install python-dotenv
pip install hatchet-sdk
```

Then run the following code:

```python filename="worker.py" copy
from hatchet_sdk import Hatchet
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

hatchet = Hatchet(debug=True)

@hatchet.workflow(name="first-python-workflow",on_events=["user:create"])
class MyWorkflow:
    @hatchet.step()
    def step1(self, context):
        return {
            "result": "success"
        }

worker = hatchet.worker('first-worker')
worker.register_workflow(MyWorkflow())

worker.start()
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
Make sure you install `@hatchet-dev/typescript-sdk` via:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @hatchet-dev/typescript-sdk
```

Then run the following code:


```typescript filename="worker.ts" copy
import Hatchet from '@hatchet-dev/typescript-sdk';
import { Workflow } from '@hatchet-dev/typescript-sdk/dist/workflow';

const hatchet = Hatchet.init();

const workflow: Workflow = {
  id: 'first-typescript-workflow',
  description: 'This is my first workflow',
  on: {
    event: 'user:create',
  },
  steps: [
    {
      name: 'step1',
      run: async (ctx) => {
        console.log('starting step1 with the following input', ctx.workflowInput());
        return { 
            result: 'success!' };
      },
    },
  ],
};

hatchet.run(workflow);
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

After running your worker, you should see your first workflow registered in the Hatchet dashboard:

You can now trigger this workflow by clicking the top right "Trigger workflow" button when viewing the workflow:
