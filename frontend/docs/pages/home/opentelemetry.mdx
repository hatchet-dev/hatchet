Hatchet supports exporting traces from your workflows to an [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) to improve visibility into your Hatchet tasks.

## Usage

### Setup

Hatchet's SDK provides an instrumentor that auto-instruments Hatchet code, if you opt in. Setup is straightforward:

First, install the `otel` extra with (e.g.) `pip install hatchet-sdk[otel]`. Then, import the instrumentor:

```python
from path.to.your.trace.provider import trace_provider
from hatchet_sdk.opentelemetry.instrumentor import HatchetInstrumentor

HatchetInstrumentor(tracer_provider=trace_provider).instrument()
```

You bring your own trace provider and plug it into the `HatchetInstrumentor`, call `instrument`, and that's it!

### Providing a `traceparent`

In some cases, you might also want to provide a `traceparent` so any spans created in Hatchet are children of a parent that was created elsewhere in your application. You can do that by providing a `traceparent` key in the `additional_metadata` field of the following methods:

- `hatchet.event.push`
- `hatchet.event.bulk_push`
- `hatchet.admin.run_workflow`
- `hatchet.admin.run_workflows`
- `hatchet.admin.run_workflow_async`
- `hatchet.admin.run_workflows_async`

For example:

```python
hatchet.event.push(
    "user:create",
    {'userId': '1234'},
    options={
    "additional_metadata": {
        "traceparent":"00-f1aff5c5ea45185eff2a06fd5c0ed6c5-6f4116aff54d54d1-01" ## example traceparent
    }
})
```

The `HatchetInstrumentor` also has some methods for generating traceparents that might be helpful:

1. `create_traceparent` creates a `traceparent`
2. `inject_traceparent_into_metadata` injects a traceparent into the `additional_metadata` field

### Spans

By default, Hatchet creates spans at the following points in the lifecycle of a workflow run:

1. When a trigger is run on the client side, e.g. `run_workflow()` or `push()` is called.
2. When a worker handles a task event, like starting running the task or cancelling the task

In addition, you'll get a handful of attributes set (prefixed by `hatchet.`) on the task run events, such as the workflow name and the worker id, as well as success / failure states, and so on.
