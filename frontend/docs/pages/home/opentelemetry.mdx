# OpenTelemetry

  OpenTelemetry support is currently only available for the Python SDK.

Hatchet supports exporting traces from your tasks to an [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) to improve visibility into your Hatchet tasks.

## Usage

### Setup

Hatchet's SDK provides an instrumentor that auto-instruments Hatchet code if you opt in. Setup is straightforward:

First, install the `otel` extra with (e.g.) `pip install hatchet-sdk[otel]`. Then, import the instrumentor:

```python
from path.to.your.trace.provider import trace_provider
from hatchet_sdk.opentelemetry.instrumentor import HatchetInstrumentor

HatchetInstrumentor(tracer_provider=trace_provider).instrument()
```

You bring your own trace provider and plug it into the `HatchetInstrumentor`, call `instrument`, and that's it!

  documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/python/instrumentation/)
  for more information on how to set up a trace provider.

### Spans

By default, Hatchet creates spans at the following points in the lifecycle of a task run:

1. When a trigger is run on the client side, e.g. `run()` or `push()` is called.
2. When a worker handles a task event, such as starting to run the task or cancelling the task

In addition, you'll get a handful of attributes set (prefixed by `hatchet.`) on the task run events, such as the task name and the worker ID, as well as success/failure states, and so on.

Some other important notes:

1. The instrumentor will automatically propagate the trace context between task runs, so if you spawn a task from another task, the child will correctly show up as a child of its parent in the trace waterfall.
2. You can exclude specific attributes from being attached to spans by providing the `otel` configuration option on the `ClientConfig` and passing a list of `excluded_attributes`, which come from [this list](https://github.com/hatchet-dev/hatchet/blob/main/sdks/python/hatchet_sdk/utils/opentelemetry.py).
