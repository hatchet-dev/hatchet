# Fanout

The **fanout pattern** lets a parent task dynamically spawn N child tasks in parallel, wait for all of them to complete, and collect their results. It is the go-to approach when the number of parallel units of work is determined at runtime — for example, processing every item in a list, running inference on a batch of inputs, or sending notifications to a set of users.

## How It Works

<Steps>

### Define parent and child tasks

The parent task contains the spawning logic. The child task (or child workflow) defines the unit of work to be performed for each item.

### Parent spawns N children at runtime

When the parent task executes, it iterates over its input data and spawns one child task per item. All children run in parallel across your worker fleet.

### Collect results

The parent awaits all child completions and aggregates their results into a single return value.

<Callout type="info">
  Fanout is built on top of [Procedural Child Spawning](/home/child-spawning).
  See that page for full code examples on defining tasks, spawning children,
  parallel execution, and error handling.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  When fanning out to large numbers of children, make sure your workers have
  enough slots to handle the concurrent load. See [Worker Slots](/home/workers)
  for details on configuring slot capacity.

    Process thousands of items (images, documents, records) in parallel with
    automatic load distribution across workers.

  <Cards.Card title="Multi-Provider AI Inference" href="/home/child-spawning">
    Send the same prompt to multiple LLM providers concurrently and pick the
    best response.

  <Cards.Card title="Notification Delivery" href="/home/rate-limits">
    Fan out to send notifications to N users while respecting per-provider rate
    limits.
