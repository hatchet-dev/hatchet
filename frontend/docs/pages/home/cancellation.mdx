# Cancellation in Hatchet Tasks

Hatchet provides a mechanism for canceling task executions gracefully, allowing you to signal to running tasks that they should stop running. Cancellation can be triggered on graceful termination of a worker or automatically through concurrency control strategies like [`CANCEL_IN_PROGRESS`](./concurrency.mdx#cancel_in_progress), which cancels currently running task instances to free up slots for new instances when the concurrency limit is reached.

When a task is canceled, Hatchet sends a cancellation signal to the task. The task can then check for the cancellation signal and take appropriate action, such as cleaning up resources, aborting network requests, or gracefully terminating their execution.

### CancelledError Exception

When a sync task is cancelled while waiting for a child workflow or during a cancellation-aware operation, a `CancelledError` exception is raised.

<Callout type="warning">
  **Important:** `CancelledError` inherits from `BaseException`, not
  `Exception`. This means it will **not** be caught by bare `except Exception:`
  handlers. This is intentional and mirrors the behavior of Python's
  `asyncio.CancelledError`.
</Callout>

```python
from hatchet_sdk import CancelledError, CancellationReason

@hatchet.task()
def my_task(input: MyInput, ctx: Context) -> dict:
    try:
        result = child_workflow.run(input)
    except CancelledError as e:
        # Handle cancellation - i.e. perform cleanup, then re-raise
        print(f"Task cancelled: {e.reason}")
        # Always re-raise CancelledError so Hatchet can properly handle the cancellation
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        # This will NOT catch CancelledError
        print(f"Other error: {e}")
        raise
    return result
```

### Cancellation Reasons

The `CancelledError` includes a `reason` attribute that indicates why the cancellation occurred:

| Reason                                  | Description                                                           |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CancellationReason.USER_REQUESTED`     | The user explicitly requested cancellation via `ctx.cancel()`         |
| `CancellationReason.WORKFLOW_CANCELLED` | The workflow run was cancelled (e.g., via API or concurrency control) |
| `CancellationReason.PARENT_CANCELLED`   | The parent workflow was cancelled while waiting for a child           |
| `CancellationReason.TIMEOUT`            | The operation timed out                                               |
| `CancellationReason.UNKNOWN`            | Unknown or unspecified reason                                         |

    />

### AbortError behavior

Hatchet cancellation in TypeScript is driven by an internal `ctx.abortController.signal` (an `AbortSignal`). When a task is cancelled, Hatchet aborts that signal and cancellation-aware operations (like waiting on a child run result) will reject with an **`AbortError`**.

<Callout type="warning">
  **Important:** JavaScript/TypeScript cannot make cancellation “uncatchable”. A broad `catch (e) { ... }` can swallow cancellation. Hatchet’s SDK will avoid enqueueing new child runs once the parent task is cancelled, and it will not report a cancelled task as “completed” even if user code catches the abort — but your code should still exit quickly to avoid wasted work.
</Callout>

If you must catch errors, re-throw abort/cancellation errors:

```ts
try {
  // ... work ...
  await simple.run({});
} catch (e) {
  ctx.rethrowIfCancelled(e);
  // ... other error handling ...
}
```

## Cancellation Best Practices

When working with cancellation in Hatchet tasks, consider the following best practices:

1. **Graceful Termination**: When a task receives a cancellation signal, aim to terminate its execution gracefully. Clean up any resources, abort pending operations, and perform any necessary cleanup tasks before returning from the task function.

2. **Cancellation Checks**: Regularly check for cancellation signals within long-running tasks or loops. This allows the task to respond to cancellation in a timely manner and avoid unnecessary processing.

3. **Asynchronous Operations**: If a task performs asynchronous operations, such as network requests or file I/O, consider passing the cancellation signal to those operations. Many libraries and APIs support cancellation through the `AbortSignal` interface.

4. **Error Handling**: Handle cancellation errors appropriately. Distinguish between cancellation errors and other types of errors to provide meaningful error messages and take appropriate actions.

5. **Cancellation Propagation**: If a task invokes other functions or libraries, consider propagating the cancellation signal to those dependencies. This ensures that cancellation is handled consistently throughout the task.

## Additional Features

In addition to the methods of cancellation listed here, Hatchet also supports [bulk cancellation](./bulk-retries-and-cancellations.mdx), which allows you to cancel many tasks in bulk using either their IDs or a set of filters, which is often the easiest way to cancel many things at once.

## Conclusion

Cancellation is a powerful feature in Hatchet that allows you to gracefully stop task executions when needed. Remember to follow best practices when implementing cancellation in your tasks, such as graceful termination, regular cancellation checks, handling asynchronous operations, proper error handling, and cancellation propagation.

By incorporating cancellation into your Hatchet tasks and workflows, you can build more resilient and responsive systems that can adapt to changing circumstances and user needs.
