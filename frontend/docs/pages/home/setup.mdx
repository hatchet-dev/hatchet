# Get Started with Hatchet

This guide will help you get started with Hatchet, at the end of the guide you will have a Hatchet project with a basic workflow and a worker to execute the workflow.

## Set environment variables

All Hatchet SDKs require the `HATCHET_CLIENT_TOKEN` environment variable to be set. This token is used to authenticate your requests to the Hatchet API. You can generate an API token from the Hatchet frontend by navigating to the `Settings` tab and clicking on the `API Tokens` tab. Click the `Generate API Token` button to create a new token. Set this environment variable in your project, and **do not share it publicly**.

```bash copy
export HATCHET_CLIENT_TOKEN="<your-client-token>"
```

Additionally, if you are a self-hosted user provisioning without TLS enabled, you will need to set the `HATCHET_CLIENT_TLS_STRATEGY` environment variable to `none`. If you are on Hatchet Cloud, TLS is enabled by default, so this is not required.

```bash copy
export HATCHET_CLIENT_TLS_STRATEGY=none
```
