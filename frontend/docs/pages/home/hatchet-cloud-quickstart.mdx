# Hatchet Cloud Quickstart

Welcome to Hatchet! This guide walks you through getting set up on Hatchet Cloud. If you'd like to self-host Hatchet, please see the [self-hosted quickstart](../../self-hosting/) instead.

## Quickstart

<Steps>

### Sign up

If you haven't already signed up for Hatchet Cloud, please register [here](https://cloud.onhatchet.run).

### Set up your tenant

In Hatchet Cloud, you'll be shown a screen to create your first tenant. A tenant is a logical separation of your environments (e.g. `dev`, `staging`, `production`). Each tenant has its own set of users who can access it.

After creating your tenant, navigate to your Hatchet dashboard and navigate to your settings tab. You should see a section called "API Keys". Click "Create API Key", input a name for the key and copy the key. Place the following in a `.env` file:

```sh
HATCHET_CLIENT_TOKEN="<your-api-key>"
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  The Python SDK uses [Pydantic
  Settings](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/pydantic_settings/) to
  manage configuration, which will automatically try to load environment
  variables from a `.env` file, if one is present.
</Callout>

That's it! You've successfully set up your first Hatchet tenant and are ready to run your first workflow.
