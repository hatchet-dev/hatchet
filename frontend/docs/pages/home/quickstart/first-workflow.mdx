After completing your [installation and setup](./installation), create a `worker.py` file with the following contents:

```python filename="worker.py" copy
from hatchet_sdk import Hatchet
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

hatchet = Hatchet(debug=True)

@hatchet.workflow(name="first-python-workflow",on_events=["user:create"])
class MyWorkflow:
    @hatchet.step()
    def step1(self, context):
        return {
            "result": "success"
        }

worker = hatchet.worker('first-worker')
worker.register_workflow(MyWorkflow())

worker.start()
```

Open a new terminal and start the worker with:

```sh
python3 worker.py
```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
After completing your [installation and setup](./installation), copy the following code into a `worker.ts` file:

```typescript filename="worker.ts" copy
import Hatchet, { Workflow } from "@hatchet-dev/typescript-sdk";
import dotenv from "dotenv";

dotenv.config();

const hatchet = Hatchet.init();

const workflow: Workflow = {
  id: "first-typescript-workflow",
  description: "This is my first workflow",
  on: {
    event: "user:create",
  },
  steps: [
    {
      name: "step1",
      run: async (ctx) => {
        console.log(
          "starting step1 with the following input",
          ctx.workflowInput(),
        );

        return {
          result: "success!",
        };
      },
    },
  ],
};

async function main() {
  const worker = await hatchet.worker("example-worker");
  await worker.registerWorkflow(workflow);
  worker.start();
}

main();
```

Next, modify your `package.json` to include a script to start:

```json
{
  // ...rest of your `package.json`
  "scripts": {
    // ...existing scripts
    "worker": "npx ts-node worker.ts"
  }
}
```

Now to start the worker, in a new terminal run:

```sh npm2yarn
npm run worker
```

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

The worker is now running and listening for steps to execute. You should see your first worker registered in the `Workers` tab of the Hatchet dashboard:

You can now trigger your first workflow by navigating to the `Workflows` tab, selecting your workflow, and clicking the top right "Trigger workflow" button:

![Quickstart 2](/quickstart-2.png)

There are multiple ways you can interact with Hatchet workflows:

- Trigger workflows from your existing APIs
- Trigger workflows from the dashboard
- Replay steps in workflows from the dashboard

## Next Steps

Now that you have your first workflow running, you can start to build more complex workflows and integrate them into your existing systems. Check out the language-specific SDKs for more information on how to build workflows.
