# Installation and Setup

Welcome to Hatchet! This guide walks you through getting set up on Hatchet Cloud. If you'd like to self-host Hatchet, please see the [self-hosted quickstart](../../self-hosting/) instead.

## Step 1 - Request Access

If you haven't already requested access to Hatchet Cloud, please fill out the form [here](https://hatchet.run/request-access). We'll get back to you within 1 business day.

## Step 2 - Set up your Development Tenant

Each Hatchet instance runs on a unique subdomain for your organization (e.g. `mycompany.onhatchet.run`). Within each instance, you can create multiple tenants to logically separate your environments (e.g. `dev`, `staging`, `production`). Each tenant has its own set of users who can access it.

When you get access to Hatchet, you'll be given a development tenant to use. This will allow you to create your development workflows and invite your team members to collaborate. We recommend utilizing a different development tenant for each engineer on your team.

When you get access to the tenant, navigate to your Hatchet dashboard and to your settings tab. You should see a section called "API Keys". Click "Create API Key", input a name for the key and copy the key. Then set the following environment variables:

```sh
HATCHET_CLIENT_TOKEN="<your-api-key>"
```

## Step 3 - Install Dependencies

<Tabs items={['Python', 'Typescript']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

```sh
pip install python-dotenv
pip install hatchet-sdk
```

We are using [`python-dotenv`](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) to load the environment variables from a `.env` file. This isn't required, and you can use your own method to load environment variables.

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
First, install `@hatchet-dev/typescript-sdk` via:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @hatchet-dev/typescript-sdk
npm i dotenv
```

We also use `dotenv` to load the environment variables from a `.env` file. This isn't required, and you can use your own method to load environment variables.
