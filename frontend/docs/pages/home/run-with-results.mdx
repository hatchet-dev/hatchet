# Running a Workflow with Results

> This example assumes we have a [workflow](./basic-workflows.mdx) registered on a running [worker](./workers.mdx).

One method for running a workflow in Hatchet is to run it and wait for its result. Some example use cases for this type of workflow trigger include:

1. Fanout patterns, where a parent fans out work to a number of children, and wants to receive the results of those child tasks and make some decision based on them. For example, if each child run fips a coin, and the parent wants to count up how many heads there were and do something with that information.
2. Waiting for long-running API calls to complete, such as if calling an LLM. For instance, if you had a part of your product that writes a poem for a user, your backend might run a `write_poem` workflow, which in turn calls an LLM, and then your backend would wait for that workflow to complete and return its result (the poem).

You can use your `Workflow` object to run a workflow and wait for it to complete by calling the `run` method. This method will block until the workflow completes and return the result.

```python
from src.workflows import my_workflow, MyWorkflowInputModel

result = my_workflow.run(MyWorkflowInputModel(foo="bar"))
```

You can also `await` the result of `aio_run`:

```python
result = await my_workflow.aio_run(input=MyWorkflowInputModel(foo="bar"))
```

Note that the type of `input` here is a Pydantic model that matches the input schema of your workflow.
