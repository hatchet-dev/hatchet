# SDK Overview

Welcome to the Hatchet SDK Reference! Hatchet is a distributed, fault-tolerant task queue designed to solve scaling problems like **concurrency**, **fairness**, and **rate limiting**.

For more information on Hatchet, see the [Introduction to Hatchet](/home).

## Available SDKs

Hatchet is available in the following languages:

- [Python](/sdks/python-sdk/setup)
- [Typescript](/sdks/typescript-sdk/setup)

Please [reach out](mailto:contact@hatchet.run) if you would like to use Hatchet in a different language.

## Quick Start Repos

There are two steps to getting started with Hatchet:

1. getting access to a Hatchet engine instance and installing the Hatchet SDK. You can get access to a Hatchet engine instance by [requesting access](https://hatchet.run/request-access) to Hatchet Cloud or [self-hosting Hatchet](https://docs.hatchet.run/self-hosting).

2. Once you have access to a Hatchet engine instance, you can install the Hatchet SDK in your application.
