## Workflow

Bases: `BaseWorkflow[TWorkflowInput]`

A Hatchet workflow, which allows you to define tasks to be run and perform actions on the workflow.

Workflows in Hatchet represent coordinated units of work that can be triggered, scheduled, or run on a cron schedule. Each workflow can contain multiple tasks that can be arranged in dependencies (DAGs), have customized retry behavior, timeouts, concurrency controls, and more.

Example:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from hatchet_sdk import Hatchet

class MyInput(BaseModel):
    name: str

hatchet = Hatchet()
workflow = hatchet.workflow("my-workflow", input_type=MyInput)

@workflow.task()
def greet(input, ctx):
    return f"Hello, {input.name}!"

# Run the workflow
result = workflow.run(MyInput(name="World"))
```

Workflows support various execution patterns including:
- One-time execution with `run()` or `aio_run()`
- Scheduled execution with `schedule()`
- Cron-based recurring execution with `create_cron()`
- Bulk operations with `run_many()`

Tasks within workflows can be defined with `@workflow.task()` or `@workflow.durable_task()` decorators and can be arranged into complex dependency patterns.
