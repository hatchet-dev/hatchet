# Running Workflows via API

Workflows can be triggered from the API by calling `runWorkflow`. This method is available on the `hatchet.admin` client:

```ts filename="run-workflow.ts" copy
import Hatchet from "@hatchet-dev/typescript-sdk";

const hatchet = Hatchet.init();

const workflowRun = hatchet.admin.runWorkflow(
  "api-trigger-workflow",
  {
    test: "test",
  },
  {
    additionalMetadata: {
      hello: "moon",
    },
  },
);
```

This method takes the following parameters:

- `workflowName` (**string, required**): The name of the workflow to trigger.
- `input` (**T, required**): The input to the workflow. This should be a JSON-serializable dict.
- `options` (**optional**): Additional options to pass to the workflow. The current options are supported:
  - `additionalMetadata`: A dict of key-value strings to attach to the workflow run. This metadata will be shown in the Hatchet UI and will be available in API endpoints for listing/filtering.

For more information on how to interact with the return value of `runWorkflow`, see the documentation for [getting workflow run results](./get-workflow-results).
