# Running Workflows via API

Workflows can be triggered from the API by calling `runWorkflow`. This method is available on the `hatchet.admin` client:

```ts filename="run-workflow.ts" copy
import Hatchet from "@hatchet-dev/typescript-sdk";

const hatchet = Hatchet.init();

const workflowRun = hatchet.admin.runWorkflow(
  "api-trigger-workflow",
  {
    test: "test",
  },
  {
    additionalMetadata: {
      hello: "moon",
    },
  },
);
```

## Usage

### Type Parameters

- `Q`: The type of the input data for the workflow. Default is `JsonValue`.
- `P`: The type of the output data from the workflow. Default is `JsonValue`.

### Parameters

- `workflowName` (`string`): The name of the workflow to be spawned. This will be concatenated with the client's namespace to form the full workflow name.
- `input` (`Q`): The input data for the workflow. The type of this data is specified by the generic type parameter `Q`.
- `options` (**optional**): Additional options to pass to the workflow. The current options are supported:
  - `additionalMetadata`: A dict of key-value strings to attach to the workflow run. This metadata will be shown in the Hatchet UI and will be available in API endpoints for listing/filtering.

### Returns

- [`WorkflowRunRef`](./get-workflow-results): A reference to the workflow run, with the output data type specified by the generic type parameter `P`.

### Exceptions

- `HatchetError`: Thrown if there is any error during the workflow spawning process, with the error message provided.
