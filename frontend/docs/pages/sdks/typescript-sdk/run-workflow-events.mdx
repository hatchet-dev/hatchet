# Running Workflows via Events

For workflows with event triggers, you can push events to the Hatchet API with the `hatchet.event.push` method:

```ts
import Hatchet from "@hatchet-dev/typescript-sdk";

const hatchet = Hatchet.init();

hatchet.event.push("user:create", {
  test: "test",
});
```

The event's input data will be passed to the workflow run as the input, and is retrievable via the `context.workflow_input()` method.
