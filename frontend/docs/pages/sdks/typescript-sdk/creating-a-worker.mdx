# Creating a Worker

Workers can be created via the `hatchet.run()` method, after instantiating a `hatchet` instance.
It will automatically read in any `HATCHET_CLIENT` environment variables, which can be set in the process by using something like `dotenv`.

For example:

```ts
import Hatchet, { Workflow } from "@hatchet-dev/typescript-sdk";

const hatchet = Hatchet.init();

// workflow code...

async function main() {
  const worker = await hatchet.worker("example-worker");
  await worker.registerWorkflow(workflow);
  worker.start();
}

main();
```

## Options

### Name

The `hatchet.worker()` method takes a simple name parameter which can be used to identify the worker on the Hatchet dashboard.

### Max Runs

The `maxRuns` option can be used to limit the number of runs a worker will process before stopping. This is particularly useful for resource-intensive workers. For example, to limit the worker to only executing 1 run at a time, you can use the following code:

```ts
hatchet.worker("example-worker", 1);
```
