# Setup

## Installation

To install the Hatchet Go SDK:

```sh
go get github.com/hatchet-dev/hatchet
```

## Usage

You should have generated a set of client certificates (or received them through Hatchet cloud). These certificates are `ca.cert`, `client-worker.pem`, and `client-worker.key`. You should also make note of the Hatchet server address and the tenant ID you'd like to connect to.

```sh
HATCHET_CLIENT_TENANT_ID=<tenant-id>
HATCHET_CLIENT_TLS_ROOT_CA_FILE=./certs/ca.cert
HATCHET_CLIENT_TLS_CERT_FILE=./certs/client-worker.pem
HATCHET_CLIENT_TLS_KEY_FILE=./certs/client-worker.key
HATCHET_CLIENT_TLS_SERVER_NAME=<hatchet-domain>
```

Assuming these variables are set in the environment, you can then initialize a client with the following code:

```go
c, err := client.New(
	client.WithHostPort("<hatchet-domain>", 443),
)

if err != nil {
	return fmt.Errorf("error creating client: %w", err)
}
```
