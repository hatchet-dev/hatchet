# Running Scheduled Workflows

Workflows can be scheduled from the API to run at some future time by calling `schedule_workflow`. This method is available on the `hatchet.client.admin` client:

```py filename="scheduled_workflow.py" copy
from hatchet_sdk import Hatchet, ClientConfig

hatchet = Hatchet()

now = datetime.now()
future_time = now + timedelta(seconds=15)

workflowRun = hatchet.client.admin.schedule_workflow(
    "ManualTriggerWorkflow",
    [future_time],
    {"test": "test"},
)
```

This method takes the following parameters:

- `workflow_name` (**required**): The name of the workflow to trigger. If you have not overriden the workflow name in the `hatchet.workflow` decorator, this should match the name of the workflow class.
- `schedule_time` (**required**): The time at which the workflow should be scheduled to run. This should be a `datetime` object.
- `input` (**required**): The input to the workflow. This should be a JSON-serializable dict.
