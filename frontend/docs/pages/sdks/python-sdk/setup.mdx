# Setup

## Installation

If using `pip`, you can run:

```sh
pip install hatchet-sdk
```

If using `poetry`:

```sh
poetry add hatchet-sdk
```

## Usage

Navigate to your Hatchet dashboard and navigate to your settings tab. You should see a section called "API Keys". Click "Create API Key", input a name for the key and copy the key. Then set the following environment variables:

```sh
HATCHET_CLIENT_TOKEN="<your-api-key>"
```

## Advanced

### TLS with self-signed server certificates

> **Note:** All Hatchet instances use TLS by default. Instances on Hatchet Cloud use a publicly signed server certificate, and the server name is automatically set based on the domain.

If you're using self-signed server certificates, you'll need to set the following environment variables in addition to the ones above:

```sh
HATCHET_CLIENT_TLS_ROOT_CA_FILE=./certs/ca.cert # replace with your root CA cert
HATCHET_CLIENT_TLS_SERVER_NAME=<hatchet-domain> # replace with your server name
```

### mTLS

If you have mTLS enabled, you'll need to set the following environment variables in addition to the ones above:

```sh
HATCHET_CLIENT_TLS_ROOT_CA_FILE=./certs/ca.cert
HATCHET_CLIENT_TLS_CERT_FILE=./certs/client-worker.pem
HATCHET_CLIENT_TLS_KEY_FILE=./certs/client-worker.key
HATCHET_CLIENT_TLS_SERVER_NAME=<hatchet-domain>
```
