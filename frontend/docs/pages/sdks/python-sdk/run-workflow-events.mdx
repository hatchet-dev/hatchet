# Running Workflows via Events

For workflows with event triggers, you can push events to the Hatchet API with the `client.event.push` method:

```py
from hatchet_sdk import Hatchet

hatchet = Hatchet()

hatchet.client.event.push(
    "user:create",
    {
        "test": "test"
    }
)
```

The event's input data will be passed to the workflow run as the input, and is retrievable via the `context.workflow_input()` method.
