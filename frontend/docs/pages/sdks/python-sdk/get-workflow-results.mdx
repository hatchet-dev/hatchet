# Getting Workflow Run Results

It is possible to wait for or stream the results of a workflow run by getting a `WorkflowRunRef`. This is the return value of the `run_workflow` and `get_workflow_run` methods on the `hatchet.admin` client, or the `spawn_workflow` method on a `Context` object. For example:

```py filename="get_workflow_run.py" copy
from hatchet_sdk import Hatchet, ClientConfig

hatchet = Hatchet()

workflow_run_ref = hatchet.admin.get_workflow_run(
    "5a3a617d-1200-4ee2-92e6-be4bd27ca26f",
)

result = await workflow_run_ref.result()

print(result)
```

This method takes the `workflow_run_id` as a parameter and returns a reference to the workflow run.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸª“">
If you need to get the workflow run id from a different method than where it was invoked, you can store the value of the `workflow_run_id` attribute of the return value of [`run_workflow`](./run-workflow-api) or [`spawn_workflow`](./run-workflow-child). For example:

```py
workflow_run = hatchet.admin.run_workflow(
    "ManualTriggerWorkflow",
    {"test": "test"},
)

print(f"spawned workflow run: {workflow_run.workflow_run_id}")
```

</Callout>

Note that the `result` method is an coroutine that must be awaited. It returns a dict of each step run's result in the workflow. For example:

```py
{
    "step1": {
        "result1": "success"
    },
    "step2": {
        "result2": "success"
    }
}
```

## Streaming Results

It is also possible to stream the results of a workflow run as each step is executed. This can be done via the `stream` method on the `WorkflowRunRef` object:

```py filename="stream_workflow_run.py" copy
from hatchet_sdk import Hatchet, ClientConfig

workflow_run_ref = hatchet.admin.get_workflow_run(
    "5a3a617d-1200-4ee2-92e6-be4bd27ca26f",
)

listener = workflow_run_ref.stream()

async for event in listener:
    print(event.type, event.payload)
```

Note that this is an async generator, so you must use `async for` to iterate over the events.
