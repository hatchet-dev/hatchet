# Creating a Worker

Workers can be created via the `hatchet.worker()` method, after instantiating a `hatchet` instance. It will automatically read in any `HATCHET_CLIENT` environment variables, which can be set in the process by using something like `dotenv`. For example:

```py
from hatchet_sdk import Hatchet
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

hatchet = Hatchet()

# workflow code...

worker = hatchet.worker('test-worker')
worker.register_workflow(workflow)

# worker.start() is blocking
worker.start()
```

## Options

The `hatchet.worker()` method takes a number of options:

- `name`: The name of the worker. This is used to identify the worker in the Hatchet UI.
- `max_runs`: The maximum number of concurrent runs that the worker can run. Defaults to `None` (unlimited runs).
- `debug`: Whether to enable debug logging. Defaults to `False`.
- `handle_kill`: Whether to call `sys.exit()` when the worker receives a `SIGTERM` signal after graceful termination. Defaults to `True`.
