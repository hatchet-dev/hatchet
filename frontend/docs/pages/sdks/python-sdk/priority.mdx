# Setting Workflow Priority

<Callout type="info">This feature is currently in beta and may be subject to change.</Callout>

You can set different priorities for your workflows to make sure that the most important tasks are
handled first, especially when resources are limited. This means that if your worker pool is busy
with many tasks, the high-priority tasks will be processed before the lower-priority ones.

You can assign a priority value of 1, 2, or 3 to a worker. The higher the number, the higher the
priority compared to others.

For example, let's say you have two workflows: `high_prio_workflow` and `low_prio_workflow`. If you
set `low_prio_workflow` to a priority of 1 and `high_prio_workflow` to a higher priority of 2 or 3,
the system will prioritize `high_prio_workflow` when a worker is available. Below is a code example
showing how this works.

```py
import asyncio

from hatchet_sdk import Context
from hatchet_sdk.v2.hatchet import Hatchet

hatchet = Hatchet(debug=True)

@hatchet.function(default_priority=2)
async def high_prio_workflow(ctx: Context) -> dict:
    await asyncio.sleep(5)
    return {"return_string": "High Priority Return"}

@hatchet.function(default_priority=1)
async def low_prio_workflow(ctx: Context) -> dict:
    await asyncio.sleep(5)
    return {"return_string": "Low Priority Return"}

worker = hatchet.worker("example-priority-worker", max_runs=1)

hatchet.admin.run(low_prio_workflow, {})
hatchet.admin.run(low_prio_workflow, {})

hatchet.admin.run(high_prio_workflow, {})
hatchet.admin.run(high_prio_workflow, {})

worker.start()
```
