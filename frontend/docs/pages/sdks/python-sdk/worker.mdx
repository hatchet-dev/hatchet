# Worker Configuration

Workers can be created via the `hatchet.worker()` method, after [instantiating a `hatchet` instance](./client). The `hatchet.worker()` method takes the following arguments:

- `name` (**required**): The name of the worker. This is used to identify the worker in the Hatchet UI.
- `max_runs`: The maximum number of concurrent step runs that the worker can run. If not set, it defaults to `100`. Note that this value is different from the number of concurrent runs per workflow.

## Registering Workflows

Workers can register workflows by calling `worker.register_workflow` with a workflow class instance. There is no limit to the number of workflows which can be registered for each worker. For example:

```py
from hatchet_sdk import Context, Hatchet

hatchet = Hatchet(debug=True)

@hatchet.workflow()
class WorkflowOne:
    @hatchet.step()
    async def step(self, context: Context):
        return {"test1": "test1"}

@hatchet.workflow()
class WorkflowTwo:
    @hatchet.step()
    async def step(self, context: Context):
        return {"test2": "test2"}

worker = hatchet.worker('test-worker')
worker.register_workflow(WorkflowOne())
worker.register_workflow(WorkflowTwo())
worker.start()
```

## Starting a Worker

Workers can be started by calling either `worker.start` or `worker.async_start`. We recommend that `worker.start` is the last call made when running a worker.

The `worker.start` method is blocking, while `worker.async_start` can be awaited or started via `asyncio.create_task`.

### Example: `worker.start`

```py
from hatchet_sdk import Context, Hatchet

hatchet = Hatchet()

# ... workflow definitions

def main():
    worker = hatchet.worker("test-worker", max_runs=4)
    worker.register_workflow(Workflow())
    worker.start()

main()
```

### Example: `worker.async_start`

```py
from hatchet_sdk import Context, Hatchet

hatchet = Hatchet()

# ... workflow definitions

async def main():
    worker = hatchet.worker("test-worker", max_runs=4)
    worker.register_workflow(Workflow())
    await worker.async_start()

asyncio.run(main())
```
