# Worker Configuration

Workers can be created via the `hatchet.worker()` method, after [instantiating a `hatchet` instance](./client). The `hatchet.worker()` method takes the following arguments:

- `name` (**required**): The name of the worker. This is used to identify the worker in the Hatchet UI.
- `max_runs`: The maximum number of concurrent step runs that the worker can run. If not set, it defaults to `100`. Note that this value is different from the number of concurrent runs per workflow.

## Registering Workflows

Workers can register workflows by calling `worker.register_workflow` with a workflow class instance. There is no limit to the number of workflows which can be registered for each worker. For example:

<GithubSnippet src={WorkflowRegistration} target="WorkflowRegistration" />

## Starting a Worker

Workers can be started by calling `worker.start`. We recommend that `worker.start` is the last call made when running a worker, as the `worker.start` method is blocking.
