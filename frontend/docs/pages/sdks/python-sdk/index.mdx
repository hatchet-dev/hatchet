# Python SDK

This is the Hatchet Python SDK reference. On this page, we'll get you up and running with a Python worker. This guide assumes that you already have a Hatchet engine instance running. If you don't, you can:

- Sign up on [Hatchet Cloud](https://cloud.onhatchet.run)
- [Self-host Hatchet](https://docs.hatchet.run/self-hosting)

<Callout type="info" emoji="🪓">
  If you run into any issues, please file an issue on the [Hatchet Python SDK
  GitHub repository](https://github.com/hatchet-dev/hatchet-python).
</Callout>

## Installation

If using `pip`, you can run:

```sh
pip install hatchet-sdk
```

If using `poetry`:

```sh
poetry add hatchet-sdk
```

## Generate a Token

Navigate to your Hatchet dashboard and navigate to your settings tab. You should see a section called "API Keys". Click "Create API Key", input a name for the key and copy the key. Then set the following environment variables:

```sh
HATCHET_CLIENT_TOKEN="<your-api-key>"
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="🪓">
You may need to set additional environment variables depending on your self-hosted configuration. The Hatchet clients default to SSL by default, but to disable this you can set:

```
HATCHET_CLIENT_TLS_STRATEGY=none
```

</Callout>

## Run your first worker

Make sure you've set the `HATCHET_CLIENT_TOKEN` environment variable via `export HATCHET_CLIENT_TOKEN="<your-api-key>"`. Then copy and run the following Python script via `python worker.py`:

```python filename="worker.py" copy
import asyncio
from hatchet_sdk import Context, Hatchet, EmptyModel

hatchet = Hatchet(debug=True)

first_workflow = hatchet.workflow(name="FirstWorkflow")

@first_workflow.task(timeout="2s")
async def step1(input: EmptyModel, ctx: Context) -> dict[str, str]:
    print("started step1")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("finished step1")

    return {"test": "test"}

@first_workflow.task(parents=[step1], timeout="4s")
async def step1(input: EmptyModel, ctx: Context) -> None:
    print("started async step2")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("finished step2")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    worker = hatchet.worker("first-worker", max_runs=4, workflows=[first_workflow])
    worker.start()
```

## Run your first workflow

The worker is now running and listening for steps to execute. You should see your first worker registered in the `Workers` tab of the Hatchet dashboard:

![Quickstart 1](/quickstart-1.png)

You can now trigger your first workflow by navigating to the `Workflows` tab, selecting your workflow, and clicking the top right "Trigger workflow" button:

![Quickstart 2](/quickstart-2.png)

That's it! You've successfully deployed Hatchet and run your first workflow.

## Next Steps

Congratulations on running your first workflow!
