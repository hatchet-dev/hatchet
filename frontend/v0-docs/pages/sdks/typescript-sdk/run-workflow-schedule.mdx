# Running Scheduled Workflows

Workflows can be scheduled from the API to run at some future time by calling `scheduleWorkflow`. This method is available on the `hatchet.admin` client:

```ts
import Hatchet from "@hatchet-dev/typescript-sdk";

const hatchet = Hatchet.init();

const now = new Date();

hatchet.admin.scheduleWorkflow("workflowName", {
  schedules: [now],
});
```

This method takes the following parameters:

- `workflowName` (**required**): The name of the workflow to schedule.
- `options` (**optional**): an object with the following properties:
  - `schedules` (**optional**): An array of `Date` objects representing the times at which the workflow should be scheduled to run.
  - `input` (**optional**): The input to the workflow. This should be a JSON-serializable dict.
